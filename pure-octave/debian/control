Description: Octave interface for the Pure programming language
 Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term
 rewriting. This package provides an Octave module for Pure which is based on
 Paul Kienzle's octave_embed. It allows you to execute arbitrary Octave
 commands and functions from Pure, and the embedded Octave interpreter can
 call back into Pure as well.
