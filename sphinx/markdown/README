.. % rst-markdown(1) | Version @version@

.. Note: This document is written in RST syntax, but you can easily convert
.. it to Markdown format using the rst-markdown script itself! For
.. convenience, the Makefile offers a target for this, just run ``make
.. markdown``. Similarly, ``make html`` and ``make pdf`` will format the
.. manual as an html or pdf file, respectively.

Synopsis
========

rst-markdown [*options* ...] [*files* ...]

Description
===========

This script acts as a frontend to Pandoc_ which allows you to convert plain
RST documents and (some) Sphinx elements to Markdown format (or any other
output format supported by Pandoc). It was primarily written for converting
the Pure documentation files, but might also work with other, similar
RST-based documents. (The recognition of Sphinx description items assumes the
Pure domain, though, so the script will surely need some work if you want to
use it for other Sphinx domains.)

.. _Pandoc: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/

Considerable effort is spent to keep the internal document links to RST
section headers intact, as well as RST link targets and Sphinx markup for
descriptions of program options, functions, variables, etc. For the rest of
the conversion we rely on Pandoc. The script certainly isn't perfect, but it
does a reasonably good job (usually much better than just pandoc on its own),
and it gives you a quick way to obtain Markdown documents from the Pure
manuals which can then be edited and formatted in various ways.

Usage
=====

The input files must all be in RST format. If none are specified, input is
read from stdin. Output goes to stdout, unless an output filename is given
with :option:`-o` / :option:`--output`.

The output format is usually auto-detected by pandoc if an output filename is
specified with :option:`-o` / :option:`--output`, otherwise you can specify
the desired target format with the :option:`-t` / :option:`--to` option. The
script understands a number of other pandoc options which are simply passed
through, and the :option:`-O` / :option:`--options` option lets you pass any
other options not directly supported by the script. Please use ``rst-markdown
-h`` to get a brief summary of the available options.

Options
=======

General Options
---------------

.. option:: -h
.. option:: --help

   Print a short help message, including a brief summary of the available
   options.

.. option:: -v
.. option:: --verbose

   Print some progress information useful for debugging purposes.

Pandoc Options
--------------

The recognized pandoc options are listed below. They are simply passed
through. Please see the pandoc documentation for a closer description of
these.

.. option:: -o output-file
.. option:: --output output-file

   Set the name of the pandoc output file.

.. option:: -r
.. option:: --reference-links

   Use reference rather than inline links.

.. option:: -s
.. option:: --standalone

   Produce a standalone document.

.. option:: -S
.. option:: --smart

   Produce smart quotes, dashes, etc. in the output.

.. option:: -t output-format
.. option:: --to output-format

   Set the pandoc output format.

The following option can be used to pass any other pandoc option which isn't
directly supported by the script.

.. option:: -O pandoc-options
.. option:: --options pandoc-options

   Additional options to be passed to pandoc. This is cumulative, so each
   argument given with :option:`-O` is added to the pandoc options.

Special Options
---------------

There are also a number of special pre-, post-processing and formatting
options which affect the generated output. They are listed below.

.. option:: -d
.. option:: --date
.. option:: -V
.. option:: --version

   These options allow you to substitute values for the most commonly used
   meta variables (:verb:`\|today\|` and :verb:`\@version\@`) in RST
   source files. By default, the current date is used, and the script also
   tries to detect the version number from the ``version`` variable in a
   Makefile in the current directory, if present.

.. option:: -C
.. option:: --callouts

   Use a somewhat fancier formatting for RST note blocks (``.. note::``),
   which makes the Markdown rendering look a bit more like in the
   Sphinx-formatted docs.

.. option:: -c[max-items]
.. option:: --collapse-items[=max-items]

   Collapse adjacent item headers in Sphinx markup for options, functions,
   variables, etc., if possible. This gives a denser format if there are
   multiple items for the same description text, but only works if the items
   are rendered as Markdown definition lists (which is the default, but can be
   disabled with the :option:`-H` / :option:`--headers` option, see below).
   This option takes an optional argument which, if specified, denotes the
   desired maximum number of items per header line.

.. option:: -D[/pattern/format/]
.. option:: --describe[=/pattern/format/]

   This lets you adjust the format of generic Sphinx description items
   (``.. describe::``). The optional argument takes the form of a regex
   replacement which is applied to the item text; the result should be valid
   Markdown text. The default format is ``/.*/`\0`/`` which formats the entire
   item text as literal (typewriter) text. Something like, e.g.,
   ``/(\w+(\s+\w+)*):\s+(.*)/\1: `\3`/`` might be used to format a description
   of the form ``some text: foo bar`` so that the text up to the colon is set
   in regular text font (you can use :option:`-D` / :option:`--describe`
   without argument to give this specific example a try). This option is not
   straightforward to use (it's much too easy to mess up the replacement and
   end up with invalid Markdown), but may be useful for scripted conversions
   if you're not content with the default formatting of these items.

.. option:: -H
.. option:: --headers

   Uses Markdown section headers rather than definition lists for Sphinx
   descriptions of options, functions, variables, etc., which potentially
   makes links to these items work in some output formats other than
   html. Please check the notes below for details.

.. option:: -i index-file
.. option:: --index index-file

   Creates an index file in order to make cross references between separate
   documents work (see `External Document Links`_ below for details). The
   argument denotes the name of the index file to be created or updated.

.. option:: -N template
.. option:: --name template

   Document name template for cross-document links. This must be a printf
   template with exactly one ``%s`` in it; the default is ``"%s.html"``.
   Please check `External Document Links`_  below for details.

.. option:: -n
.. option:: --no-links

   Strips all inline and reference links from the Markdown output, leaving
   just the link text in single quotes. This is useful when generating Pandoc
   output formats such as manpages (``-tman``) which don't support links and
   where the resulting output looks confusing if they are included.

.. option:: -R
.. option:: --raw

   Includes raw sections from the RST source (``.. raw::``). Pandoc seems to
   unconditionally include these sections, which usually messes up the output,
   so rst-markdown will by default strip them from the RST source during
   pre-processing, so that Pandoc never sees them. But if you really want to
   have this material included in the output then this option will give you
   that.

.. option:: -T
.. option:: --title-block

   Scrapes a Pandoc-style title block from the RST source. The title block
   should be formatted as follows (please also check the Pandoc documentation
   for a description of the title block syntax)::

     .. % Title
     .. % Author
     .. % Date

   This will be treated as a comment by RST processors. If the :option:`-T`
   option is used, then any additional frontmatter (i.e., everything leading
   up to the title block) will be stripped from the RST source, so that the
   output document begins with the Pandoc title block. (Note that this means
   that the resulting document will be empty if there's no title block in the
   source at all, so beware!)

External Document Links
=======================

Links across different documents are supported by rst-markdown (in html output
at least), if you explicitly create an index file for all the documents using
the :option:`-i` / :option:`--index` option. This is one of rst-markdown's
addon features; pandoc doesn't seem to support this as far as I can tell.

External document links generally require that you run rst-markdown on all
individual source documents *twice* (the index entries will be created or
updated during the first round of invocations, then the correct link targets
will be inserted during the second round). For instance, if you have two
documents ``a.rst`` and ``b.rst`` which link to each other, then you can run
rst-markdown twice as follows::

  rst-markdown a.rst -o a.md -i index && rst-markdown a.rst -o a.md -i index
  rst-markdown a.rst -o a.md -i index && rst-markdown a.rst -o a.md -i index

The resulting Markdown documents ``a.md`` and ``b.md`` will have
cross-document links of the form ``a.html#id`` and ``b.html#id`` so that the
links can be correctly resolved in generated html output. This generally
assumes that the final output will be html documents located in the same
directory, and that the final documents have the same basenames as the
corresponding output files (if :option:`-o` is given; otherwise, the script
uses the basename of the first RST input file for each document). If necessary
(i.e., to use other filename extensions and/or document paths), you can also
specify a printf-style template for the document part of the link targets with
the :option:`-N` / :option:`--name` option; the default naming scheme
corresponds to ``-N "%s.html"``.

Please note that this elaborate procedure is only necessary if individual
Markdown documents are created from each RST source. If you pass the entire
collection of source documents to rst-markdown in one go, then only a single
output file will be created, so all links between documents become internal
links in the output document.

Notes
=====

To run this script, you need to have Pandoc and GNU awk (as ``gawk``)
installed. The script probably needs a fairly recent Pandoc version (1.12.3
has been tested). To install the script, simply run ``make install`` in the
source directory (the installation prefix defaults to ``/usr/local``; you can
set this with the ``prefix`` make variable).

To get proper syntax highlighting for Pure, at present you have to build your
own versions of the pandoc and highlighting-kate Haskell modules. To do this,
grab the latest sources from https://github.com/jgm, and drop the Kate
syntax-highlighting for Pure (available as etc/pure.xml in the Pure sources)
into the highlighting-kate/xml folder. Then rebuild highlighting-kate and
pandoc. This is described in more detail (for the J language, but otherwise
the steps are the same) in John Baker's blog at
http://bakerjd99.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/pandoc-based-j-syntax-highlighting/.

Once the Pure highlighting is installed, you can set the default language for
code sections and the desired highlighting style with Pandoc's
``--indented-code-classes`` and ``--highlight-style`` options when creating
the target document. For instance::

  rst-markdown pure.txt -o pure.md
  pandoc --indented-code-classes=pure --highlight-style=kate pure.md -o pure.html

At present, the script only recognizes a subset of the RST and Sphinx
cross-referencing syntax, so complex documents will most likely give funky
results or not work at all.

Math elements (LaTeX inline and display formulas, ``:math:`` in RST) are fully
supported (as far as Pandoc supports them in the target document format). Note
that depending on the complexity of your formulas, you may have to use a
suitable math rendering engine for html output (i.e., ``pandoc --latexmathml``
or ``pandoc --mathjax``); please check the Pandoc documentation for details.

Internal section links are rendered as Markdown inline links by default. If
you prefer, you can force implicit reference links of the form ``[name][]`` by
specifying the :option:`-r` / :option:`--reference-links` option on the
command line (this option is simply passed to pandoc in the post-processing
stage).

Other RST link targets (``.. _name:``) in the source document should also
work, and references to these will use implicit reference links in
Markdown. Note, however, that inline html will be used to create the anchors
for internal link targets, which may not work with Pandoc target document
types other than html.

Sphinx definitions for options, functions, variables, etc. are by default
rendered as Markdown definition lists. This works fairly well, but has the
downside that the corresponding link targets are coded using inline html,
which may not work with Pandoc target document types other than html. As a
remedy, you can also translate such descriptions to Markdown section headers
instead, by using the :option:`-H` / :option:`--headers` option. Definition
lists often look better in formatted documents, but using section headers has
the advantage that Pandoc supports special PHP Markdown-style syntax for the
section link targets. This syntax isn't widely supported by 3rd party tools,
but it works with a few of Pandoc's own writer backends, please check the
Pandoc documentation for details. This might be useful in cases where you need
the links to work and the target document type doesn't support inline html
anchors.
