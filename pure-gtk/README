==================
Pure GTK+ Bindings
==================

Version @version@, |today|

Albert Graef <aggraef@gmail.com>

pure-gtk is a collection of bindings to use the GTK+ GUI toolkit version 2.x
with Pure, see http://www.gtk.org. The bindings include the gtk (+gdk),
glib, atk, cairo and pango libraries, each in their own Pure module.

At present these are just straight 1-1 wrappers of the C libraries, created
with pure-gen. So they still lack some convenience, but they are perfectly
usable already, and a higher-level API for accessing all the functionality
will hopefully become available in time. In fact *you* can help make that
happen. :) So please let me know if you'd like to give a helping hand in
improving pure-gtk.

Installation
============

You can get the latest source from
https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-gtk-@version@.tar.gz.

For Windows users, a ready-made package in msi format is available from
https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-gtk-@version@.msi.

To install from source, do the usual ``make && sudo make install`` (see the
Makefile for further options). This needs Pure and the GTK header files and
libraries. You'll also need :doc:`pure-ffi` for running the examples.

NOTE: The source release was prepared with GTK+ 2.24.4 on Ubuntu 11.04. If
you're seeing a lot of warnings and/or errors when compiling or loading the
modules, your GTK headers are probably much different from these. In that case
you should run ``make generate`` to regenerate the bindings; for this you also
need to have pure-gen installed. (If you already have pure-gen then it's a
good idea to do this anyway.)

Usage
=====

.. default-domain:: pure
.. module:: atk
.. module:: cairo
.. module:: glib
.. module:: gtk
.. module:: pango

See examples/hello.pure for a basic example. The files uiexample.pure and
uiexample.glade show how to run a GUI created with the Glade-3 interface
builder. This needs a recent version of the GtkBuilder API to work. (If you're
still running Glade-2 and an older GTK+ version, you might want to use the
older libglade interface instead. Support for that is in the Makefile, but
it's not enabled by default.) NOTE: The examples start up much faster when
they are compiled to native executables. To do this, just run ``make
examples`` after ``make``. (Be patient, this takes a while.)
