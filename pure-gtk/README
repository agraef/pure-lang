pure-gtk is a collection of bindings to use the GTK+ GUI toolkit version 2.x
with Pure, see http://www.gtk.org. The bindings include the gtk (+gdk),
glib, atk, cairo and pango libraries, each in their own Pure module.

At present these are just straight 1-1 wrappers of the C libraries, created
with pure-gen. So they still lack some convenience, but they are perfectly
usable already, and a higher-level API for accessing all the functionality
will hopefully become available in time. In fact *you* can help make that
happen. :) So please let me know if you'd like to give a helping hand in
improving pure-gtk.

To install, do the usual 'make && sudo make install' (see the Makefile for
further options). This needs Pure and the GTK header files and libraries.

This release was prepared with GTK+ 2.14.4 on SUSE 11.1. If you're seeing a
lot of warnings or even compilation errors when running 'make', your GTK
headers are probably much different from these. In that case you should run
'make generate' to regenerate the bindings; for this you also need to have
pure-gen installed. (If you already have pure-gen then it's a good idea to do
this anyway.)

See examples/hello.pure for a basic example. The files uiexample.pure and
uiexample.glade show how to run a GUI created with the Glade-3 interface
builder. This needs a recent version of the GtkBuilder API to work. (If you're
still running Glade-2 and an older GTK+ version, you might want to use the
older libglade interface instead. Support for that is in the Makefile, but
it's not enabled by default.) NOTE: The examples start up much faster when
they are compiled to native executables. To do this, just run 'make examples'
after 'make'. (Be patient, this takes a while.)

The examples/flexi-line directory contains Eduardo Cavazos' port of the
flexi-line demo. Run 'pure flexi-line-auto.pure', sit back and enjoy. There's
also an interactive version of the demo available in flexi-line.pure.

Enjoy. :)
