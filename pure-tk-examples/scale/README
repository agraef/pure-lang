Introduction
============

*Scale* is a program for rationalizing and visualizing musical scales. The
original version of this program was written in 2001 and documented in the
author's report_ (pdf file) "Musical scale rationalization: a graph-theoretic
approach", but isn't available on the web any more. The present version is a
complete rewrite in the Pure_ programming language. Compared to the original
version, it has a nicer GTK+ GUI (using Gnocl_) and visualization component
(using VTK_), and the automatic scale rationalization algorithm has been
simplified quite a bit to make it easier to use. On the other hand, the
present version still lacks the MIDI tuning applet which was part of the
original program. However, the scale program uses the scale file format of
Manuel Op de Coul's very comprehensive Scala_ program, so for the time being,
Scala can be used for tuning your MIDI files.

The scale program generally computes *disharmonicities* using an additive
measure which assigns basic "indigestibility" values to prime numbers. A
simple example of this approach is Euler's *gradus suavitatis*, but the scale
program provides various different measures derived from the works of Euler
and the contemporary composer Clarence Barlow. (The notion of "prime
indigestibilities" and the idea of automatic scale rationalization are in fact
due to Barlow.)

The harmonic distance of two rational scale tones x and y is then given by the
disharmonicity of the (rational) interval x/y. If this value is large then the
interval contains many and/or large prime factors and is thus considered
"complex" and "disharmonious". Conversely, if the value is small then the
interval is considered "harmonious" which means that the two involved scale
tones x and y are closely related to each other.

As it turns out, the resulting notion of *harmonic distance* is actually a
metric in the mathematical sense, and can thus be used to visualize the
harmonic relationships in a scale. Moreover, harmonic distances also
facilitate the manual or automatic generation of rationalizations of a given
non-rational scale. Please see the author's report_ for a detailed account on
the theory behind this.

Installation
============

You need the following dependencies:

- Pure_, including the Pure Tk and Octave modules.

- Octave_.

- `Tcl/Tk`_ and Gnocl_.

- VTK_, including the Tcl bindings.

.. _Pure: http://purelang.bitbucket.org/
.. _Octave: http://www.octave.org/
.. _Tcl/Tk: http://www.tcl.tk/
.. _Gnocl: http://www.gnocl.org/
.. _VTK: http://www.vtk.org/

You probably need fairly recent versions of all these. Pure 0.44, Octave
3.2.4, Tcl/Tk 8.5 (+ Gnocl 0.9.94g) and VTK 5.4.2 have been tested and are
known to work.

After installing all the dependencies, type ``make`` to compile and ``sudo
make install`` to install the scale program. (This just copies the scale
program to /usr/local/bin and the html version of this manual to
/usr/local/share/doc. You can specify an alternative installation prefix with
the ``prefix`` variable.)

Usage
=====

The scale program reads and writes files in the Scala_ scale file format.
(The Scala file format is the de facto standard for musical scale data. Please
check the Scala website for details on Scala and its big repository of scale
files.) To open a scale (.scl) file, use the ``Open`` button in the main
window, or specify the file on the command line, e.g.::

  scale b12tone.scl

The main window is divided into two panes, a notebook widget with the
``Graph``, ``Scale`` and ``Metric`` tabs in the upper half, and a box with
various entry fields, global parameter values, a strip of buttons and a status
line in the lower half. The status line gives feedback during operations which
may take a while to complete (in particular, when drawing and rationalizing a
scale). The ``Graph`` tab displays a 3-dimensional rendering of the scale. The
``Scale`` and ``Metric`` tabs have additional related information about the
scale points and the disharmonicity metric of the scale.

Scales can be loaded and saved with the ``Open`` and ``Save`` buttons at the
bottom of the main window, see `File Operations`_ below for details. If you
load a plain Scala file, you will be prompted if you first want to draw
it. This is also needed to generate some useful information on the ``Scale``
and ``Metric`` tabs, so you should answer ``Yes`` there. You can also just
enter a scale in Scala format (ratios as p/q where p and q are positive
integers, cent values as nonnegative floating point values) in the upper entry
field in the lower half of the main window and then click the ``Draw`` button
to render the scale. Some already rendered examples are included in the scl
subdirectory in the sources, so have a look at those to get an idea how this
works.

Note that the ``Graph`` and ``Metric`` tabs will only have interesting
information if all scale points are rational; this is required to compute the
disharmonicity metric. In this case the scale display shows an approximation
of the harmonic distances of the scale points in three-dimensional Euclidean
space, computed using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm (also
described in the author's report_). The necessary operations to create a
rational scale from any input scale are provided, see `Rationalizing a Scale`_
below.

To exit the program, click the ``Quit`` button at the right end of the button
strip (equivalently, you can also use the ``Alt-Q`` keyboard shortcut), or
just close the main window. The ``About`` button in the lower part of the main
window (keyboard shortcut: ``Alt-B``) shows some useful information about the
program, while the ``Help`` button (keyboard shortcut: ``Alt-H``) displays
this manual in a web browser.

File Operations
===============

The file operations can be found in the button strip at the bottom of the main
window.

* ``New``, ``Open``, ``Save``: Creates a new, loads an existing, or saves the
  current scale, respectively. With the latter two commands you are prompted
  to enter a scale (.scl) filename.

* ``Revert``: Reverts to the most recently saved version of the loaded scale.
  This provides a quick way to revert your changes after editing the scale or
  experimenting with different scale rationalizations.

* ``Quit``: Exit the application.

Keyboard shortcuts are generally indicated using underlining in the button
texts. So, e.g., the ``Open`` command can be invoked with ``Alt-O``, ``Save``
with ``Alt-S``, etc.

As of version 0.2, the scale program can also save scales as binary sysex
(.syx) files in the `MIDI Tuning Standard`_ (MTS) format, so that you can
easily retune any MTS-compatible synthesizer to a scale by just sending the
corresponding sysex file to it. Currently this only works with octave-based
scales which have exactly 13 scale points (including the base tone 1/1 and the
octave 2/1). The written sysex files follow the *MIDI Tuning Scale/Octave
Extensions*, please check the MTS documentation for details.

.. _MIDI Tuning Standard: http://www.midi.org/techspecs/midituning.php

To save a scale as a sysex file, simply invoke the ``Save`` operation as
usual. When prompted to enter the scale filename, edit the filename so that it
ends in the extension ``.syx``, then press ``Save``. A special dialog will
appear which allows you to choose various MTS format options. Adjust these to
your liking and press ``Save`` again (you can also cancel the operation at
this point). The available MTS format options are as follows:

* ``Realtime``: If this option is checked, a realtime sysex message will be
  written, otherwise a non-realtime message. Note that in either case, the
  tuning changes will take effect immediately if the sysex file is sent to an
  MTS-capable synthesizer. However, realtime messages will also affect already
  sounding notes, whereas non-realtime messages only apply to new notes played
  after the message is sent.

* ``Encoding``: This is a combobox which allows you to pick the desired
  encoding of the MTS message. MTS octave tunings can be encoded in either
  1-byte or 2-byte format, meaning that each tuning offset is represented as
  one or two bytes, respectively. This affects both range and precision of the
  tuning offsets, please check the MTS documentation for details. Usually it
  is a good idea to pick the 2-byte encoding, since it offers a wider range
  (-100..+100 ct) and better precision. However, if your synthesizer only
  supports the 1-byte encoding, or if you are really concerned about
  transmission bandwidth then it may be necessary to choose the 1-byte
  encoding instead. (Note that 2-byte messages need roughly twice the size of
  1-byte messages; this may affect how quickly the messages are processed,
  although this is rarely a problem with modern hardware any more).

* ``Base``: This spinbox enables you to select the reference tone of the
  tuning, given as the index of a scale point in the range 0..11. A value of 0
  indicates that the base tone of the scale will be at its nominal tuning
  (i.e., at a tuning offset of 0 ct). The spinbox allows you to change this as
  needed. Most of the time, you will want to choose the value 9 to have the
  9th scale tone (which usually corresponds to the chamber pitch A) at a
  tuning offset of 0 ct, so that A4 will be exactly at 440 Hz; this shifts the
  other tuning offsets accordingly.

By default, realtime messages and 2-byte encodings are enabled, and the base
tone is set to 9, which should be sensible defaults in most cases.

Note that in order to actually use the resulting sysex files, you need an
MTS-compatible synthesizer. Unfortunately, the MIDI Tuning Standard isn't
supported by many hardware synthesizers, so you'll probably have to use a
software synthesizer instead. A good MTS-compatible software synthesizer is
Fluidsynth_ which uses SoundFonts and has a nice graphical frontend called
Qsynth_. It is available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

.. _Fluidsynth: http://www.fluidsynth.org/
.. _Qsynth: http://qsynth.sourceforge.net

In addition, you'll need a program which can read sysex files and transmit
them to the synthesizer. There are many such programs freely available for
different platforms, such as `Simple Sysexxer`_ on Linux and `Midi-Ox`_ on
Windows. Also, many MIDI sequencing programs have this capability.

Editing The Scale
=================

At the bottom of the main window there are two entry fields. The first field
is for the scale itself, while the second one is for a short plain text
description of the scale. You can write anything in the second field (you can
also just leave it empty), but the scale data must follow the Scala
conventions:

* A quotient in the form ``p/q``, where ``p`` and ``q`` are positive integer
  values, denotes an interval by its frequency ratio, e.g.: ``1/1`` (unison),
  ``3/2`` (fifth), ``2/1`` (octave), etc.

* A nonnegative floating point value such as ``0.0``, ``701.955`` or
  ``1200.0`` denotes a Cent value (percent of an equal-tempered semitone).

No other values are allowed in this field. Different scale tones are usually
entered in ascending order, starting with the base tone ``1/1`` or ``0.0``,
with whitespace in between. For instance: ``1/1 100.0 3/2 1200.0``. (Note that
the base tone is implicit in the Scala file format, so it is not actually
stored in scale files. That's why even if you don't enter the base tone it
will be added automatically.)

To the right of the scale entry field there's another control, the "weight
threshold" spinbox which allows you to enter a harmonic distance threshold
used to render the scale graph in the ``Graph`` tab, and to determine rational
tuning alternatives in the ``Scale`` view. You'll have to adjust this value
accordingly when drawing or rationalizing a scale.

The Graph View
==============

Once a scale has been entered or loaded, you can draw it by pushing the
``Draw`` button on the ``Graph`` tab. This produces a graphical rendering of
the scale. The graphical rendering is also stored in the scale file when you
save it. Next time you load this file, the same graphical view is recreated
automatically.

If the scale contains any Cent values, the graphical display is a simple chain
of the scale points in the order in which they are given. If all scale points
are rational, however, then you'll see a proper 3-dimensional rendering of the
scale, called a "harmonicity graph." The nodes of this graph are the scale
points and the edges represent color-coded harmonic distances between some
pairs of scale points (see below).

Note that the graphical rendering isn't arbitrary, but approximates the
harmonic distances (shown on the ``Metric`` tab) between scale points by their
Euclidean distances in the drawing, so that it becomes easy to analyse the
harmonic relationships in the scale. This is achieved using a technique
called "multidimensional scaling" (MDS), see the author's report_ for details.

The graphical view can be rotated, panned and zoomed with the mouse, so that
you can take a look at the scale from all angles. To these ends, press a mouse
button in the graph window (left for rotation, middle for panning, right for
zooming) and, with the mouse button still pressed, move the mouse cursor in
any direction. Moving the mouse cursor with the left or middle button pressed
rotates or moves the view in the corresponding direction. To zoom in and out,
with the right mouse button pressed move the mouse cursor up and down,
respectively.

The following keyboard commands are recognized in the graphical view:

* ``r``: Resets the view to the default camera position (horizontal x and
  vertical y axis, with positive z coordinates in front).

* ``j``: Switches to an alternative "joystick" mode in which you only have to
  press the left/right/middle mouse button inside the view to rotate/pan/zoom.

* ``t``: Switches back to the default "trackball" mode in which you drag the
  mouse cursor with the left/right/middle mouse button to rotate/pan/zoom.

Various controls for the display can be found in the strip at the bottom of
the ``Graph`` pane:

* ``Draw``: Updates the scale information and redraws the scale. Progress will
  be shown in the progress bar in the main window (to the right of the scale
  description field). You can run this as often as you want, e.g., after
  editing the scale. Also, note that the MDS algorithm starts from a random
  start embedding, so for some scales you might get different renderings when
  you redraw the scale.

* ``Axes``: Enables or disables x, y and z axes display in the view.

* ``Labels``: Enables or disables the node label display which shows
  information about the scale points in the graph.

* ``Node label type``: A combobox which lets you choose between "Pitch" (show
  ratios or cent values; this is the default), "Factors" (prime factors of
  ratios), "Cent" (cent values), "Note" (note names, if known), "Interval"
  (interval descriptions, for known intervals) and "Ordinal" (scale index).
  These items have the same meaning as the corresponding columns on the
  ``Scale`` tab, see `The Scale View`_ below for details.

* ``Weights``: Enables or disables the edge weight display, which shows the
  harmonic distances between scale points.

* ``Edge weight function``: A combobox which lets you choose between various
  harmonic distance functions, currently: "Barlow" (Barlow's indigestability
  metric) and "Euler" (Euler's gradus suavitatis). The other functions are
  variations of these (the "/2" versions set the harmonic distance of octaves
  to zero, and the "Log" variations take the decadic logarithm of the Euler
  and Barlow metrics). Changing the weight function produces different
  drawings and information on the Scale and Metric tabs, so you're prompted to
  redraw the scale when changing this value.

Besides these, the already mentioned "weight threshold" spinbox to the right
of the scale entry field also influences the display of the harmonicity
graph. Only those edges between scale points will be drawn whose harmonic
distance does not exceed the value given in the spinbox. Moreover, the edges
are color-coded (blue denotes low, red high harmonic distances).

The Scale View
==============

The ``Scale`` tab shows detailed information about the current scale in the
form of a table whose columns include the following information:

* ``Select``: This column allows you to select pitches for the rationalization
  algorithm, see the comments below and `Rationalizing a Scale`_ for details.

* ``#``: Ordinal numbers (starting at zero = base tone).

* ``Pitch``: The ratio or cent value, as given in the scale entry field.

* ``Factors``: The factorization of the pitch, if it is rational.

* ``Cent``: The corresponding cent value.

* ``Weight``: The disharmonicity value of the interval (for rational pitches
  only), as given by the weight function on the ``Graph`` tab.

* ``Note``: The note name, if available.

* ``Interval``: The name of the interval from the Scala intnam.par file, if
  available.

Note names are computed automatically from a factorization of the ratios,
assuming a "standard" tuning for the prime factors. At present, this is only
implemented for rational pitches with the prime factors 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11,
i.e., for "11-limit" pitches. 1/1 always denotes the base note C, and the
other note names are computed relative to that.

The first column in the scale view allows you to select both scale points and
the corresponding tuning alternatives. Selected scale points are considered
"locked" for the purpose of scale rationalization. By default, all scale
points are selected which are rational already. Also, for scale points for
which alternative tunings are available, there is a tiny arrowhead in this
column. Clicking on the arrowhead symbol expands the corresponding scale point
and shows the available candidate tunings.

You can also click on the column headers to sort the scale view based on the
values in the corresponding column. This is most useful for the numeric
columns (``#``, ``Cent`` and ``Weight``). By default, the table is ordered by
ordinals (``#``), meaning that the scale points are listed in the order in
which they are written in the scale entry field. Clicking on a column title
once sorts the table in ascending order. Clicking the same column title again
reverses the order so that the values in the column are listed in descending
order.

At the bottom of the ``Scale`` tab there is a strip with operations and
parameters for selecting scale points and alternative tunings and controlling
the rationalization algorithm:

* ``Clear``: Deselect all scale points and alternative tunings.

* ``Select All``: Select all candidate tunings for which the corresponding
  scale point is *not* selected (i.e., unlocked).

* ``Refresh``: Refresh the scale display (in particular, this updates the
  available candidate tunings). This is usually done after changing the number
  of candidate tunings and tuning tolerance parameters (see below) as well as
  the weight threshold parameter in the main window.

* ``Number of tuning alternatives``: A spinbox which allows you to select the
  maximum number of alternative tunings to be shown for each scale point.

* ``Tuning tolerance``: Another spinbox with which you choose the maximum
  tuning tolerance for the alternative tunings for each scale point.

* ``Rationalization heuristic``: This lets you choose between different
  candidate tuning selection heuristics for the automatic rationalization
  algorithm. The present implementation provides two alternatives, "First" and
  "Best".

* ``Rationalize``: Automatic scale rationalization algorithm.

* ``Update``: After selecting some alternative tunings, clicking this button
  updates and redraws the scale in the main window accordingly.

Besides these, the "weight threshold" spinbox to the right of the scale entry
field determines which tuning alternatives are shown for each scale point.
Only tuning alternatives with a disharmonicity value of at most the threshold
value are shown. Moreover, for each scale point the table shows at most n
tuning alternatives in the range c-tol ... c+tol, where c is the cent value of
the scale point (as given in the ``Cent`` column of the table), and tol and n
are the tuning tolerance and the number of tuning alternatives, as given by
the corresponding spinboxes.

The order of the alternative tunings for each scale tone depends not only on
their nominal disharmonicity values but also on their absolute deviation from
the scale point in cents. To these ends, the scale program computes "weighted"
disharmonicity values using a formula by Barlow, described in the report_.
(The idea behind this is that the nominal disharmonicity values are scaled
using a Gaussian bell curve which has its center at the current pitch of the
scale point in Cents.) The first tuning alternative shown for a scale point is
thus the "best" rational approximation of the scale tone according to this
criterion, which is a compromise between harmonicity and tuning accuracy.

The Metric View
===============

For rational scales, the ``Metric`` tab shows the harmonic distance metric
used in drawing and rationalizing a scale. It takes the form of a matrix which
shows for each pair x,y of scale points their harmonic distance, i.e., the
disharmonicity of the interval x/y between the scale points. The weight
function used to determine these values can be chosen with the "edge weight
function" combobox on the ``Graph`` tab.

Rationalizing a Scale
=====================

If a scale isn't rational yet then it is not possible to analyze the interval
structure of a scale since this requires knowing the rational relationships
between the scale tones. On the ``Scale`` tab you find the necessary tools to
rationalize a scale using the following methods:

* `Manual rationalization`: Here you simply select the desired rational tuning
  alternatives for each scale tone and then use ``Update`` to update the scale
  data and redraw the scale. You can select more than one tuning alternative
  for each scale tone. In such a case the first alternative will be chosen,
  depending on the current order of the alternatives in the table. Thus the
  easiest way to quickly obtain a rationalization is to just click ``Select
  All`` and then ``Update``.

* `Automatic rationalization`: This uses a clique search algorithm on the
  harmonicity graph to determine a collection of selected tuning alternatives
  (at most one per scale point) for which the mutual harmonic distances do not
  exceed the bound given in the "weight threshold" spinbox. The selection of
  the tuning alternatives is then modified to reflect the computed solution.
  When done, just click ``Update`` as with the manual method to update the
  scale using the computed solution.

Fixing Parts of the Scale
-------------------------

With either method, selected scale points are considered *locked*, i.e., they
will not be modified by ``Rationalize`` and ``Update``. (However, the
automatic rationalization algorithm does take into account locked *rational*
scale points when computing the eligible tuning alternatives.) By default,
rational scale points are selected and thus considered locked. If you want to
re-rationalize these as well, you first need to deselect them in order to
unlock them. The quickest way to do this is to click the ``Clear`` button
which deselects all scale points (as well as all tuning alternatives). Then
use ``Select All`` to select all tuning alternatives (or select the ones that
you want manually) before running ``Rationalize`` and/or ``Update``.

Automatic Rationalization
-------------------------

The ``Rationalize`` command employs a backtracking clique search algorithm
which explores exponentially many possibilities in the worst case and thus may
be *very* slow, depending on the number of available tuning alternatives. To
deal with this, you may try to restrict the number of tuning alternatives or
fix some tunings manually beforehand.

You can also just run the algorithm and interrupt it at any time using the
``Esc`` key. The progress of the algorithm towards an optimum solution which
rationalizes all unlocked scale points is shown in the progress bar in the
main window. Usually, the algorithm will converge to a local optimum pretty
quickly (indicated by no further changes in the progress bar), at which point
you may hit ``Esc`` to interrupt the algorithm and see whether the computed
solution provides at least a viable partial rationalization of the scale.

The rationalization algorithm can also be adjusted by employing different
search heuristics. You can find these in the ``Rationalization heuristic``
combobox. In the current program version, only two search heuristics are
provided:

* ``First``: Scale points and tuning alternatives are considered in the order
  in which they are shown in the table. This strategy works pretty well if
  enough "good" candidate tunings are available and is the default.

* ``Best``: This strategy selects tuning alternatives dynamically in order to
  minimize the total disharmonicity in the chosen rationalization. This tends
  to produce overall better solutions, but is slower than the ``First``
  strategy and may also produce "funny" tunings for some scale points at
  times.

Future versions of the program may add more search heuristics as we find new
ways to guide the search towards good solutions. But note that the scale
rationalization problem is inherently difficult (NP-hard in computer science
parlance, see the report_ for details) and thus no search heuristic can
guarantee to find good solutions quickly in all cases (unless P=NP, of course,
but this is considered very unlikely by most experts).

Performing a Rationalization
----------------------------

To summarize, here is an outline of the basic steps of the rationalization
process:

0. Make sure that the current scale is saved, so that you can easily reload it
   and start over if things go awry.

1. Choose a weight threshold value (and possibly a tuning tolerance and a
   number of tuning alternatives) and do a ``Refresh`` until a suitable set of
   tuning alternatives is shown.

2. Select the scale points that you want to stay fixed, and deselect the ones
   that you want to be rationalized. By default, all rational scale points are
   selected already which is often a sensible choice, so you can skip this
   step if you're content with the default selection. You can also use
   ``Clear`` if you want to just re-rationalize everything.

3. Select the eligible tuning alternatives. Or just do ``Select All`` to
   select all tuning alternatives. (This also expands the corresponding scale
   points if necessary to show all selected alternatives.)

4. Use ``Rationalize`` to try an automatic rationalization. (Use the ``Esc``
   key to interrupt it if it takes too long.) You might need to increase the
   weight threshold and/or fine-tune the selection of tuning alternatives to
   obtain a satisfactory result using this method. (If you already selected
   some suitable tuning alternatives that you want to use, you can also just
   skip this step and directly proceed to step 5.)

5. Use ``Update`` to update the scale and redraw it.

6. If all scale tones are rational now then you're done. Otherwise, just
   repeat the steps 1-5 above until you're satisfied with the result.

7. If the solution you got is not what you wanted, just use ``Revert`` to
   revert to the original version of the scale and start over.
