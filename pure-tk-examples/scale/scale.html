<h1 id="scale---visualizing-and-rationalizing-musical-scales">Scale -
Visualizing and Rationalizing Musical Scales</h1>
<p>Albert Graef &lt;<a href="mailto:aggraef@gmail.com"
class="email">aggraef@gmail.com</a>&gt;</p>
<p>April 2014</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Scale</em> is a program for rationalizing and visualizing musical
scales. The original version of this program was written in 2001 and
documented in the author’s <a
href="http://www.musikinformatik.uni-mainz.de/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a>
(pdf file) “Musical scale rationalization: a graph-theoretic approach”,
but isn’t available on the web any more. The present version is a
complete rewrite in the <a
href="https://github.com/agraef/pure-lang">Pure</a> programming
language. Compared to the original version, it has a nicer GTK+ GUI
(using <a href="https://dr-baum.net/gnocl/">Gnocl</a>) and visualization
component (using <a href="https://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a>), and the
automatic scale rationalization algorithm has been improved to make it
easier to use. On the other hand, the present version lacks the MIDI
tuning applet which was part of the original program. However, the scale
program uses the scale file format of Manuel Op de Coul’s very
comprehensive <a href="https://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">Scala</a>
program, so you can use either Scala or the author’s <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/agraef/sclsyx">sclsyx</a> program (also
written in Pure) for tuning your MIDI synthesizers. In recent versions
of the scale program, we’ve also added an option to save tunings in
sysex format (.syx files), so that no separate utility is needed any
more if that’s all you need.</p>
<p>The scale program generally computes <em>disharmonicities</em> using
an additive measure which assigns basic “indigestibility” values to
prime numbers. A simple example of this approach is Euler’s <em>gradus
suavitatis</em>, but the scale program provides various different
measures derived from the works of Euler and the contemporary composer
Clarence Barlow. (The notion of “prime indigestibilities” and the idea
of automatic scale rationalization are in fact due to Barlow.)</p>
<p>The harmonic distance of two rational scale tones x and y is then
given by the disharmonicity of the (rational) interval x/y. If this
value is large then the interval contains many and/or large prime
factors and is thus considered “complex” and “disharmonious”.
Conversely, if the value is small then the interval is considered
“harmonious” which means that the two involved scale tones x and y are
closely related to each other.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the resulting notion of <em>harmonic distance</em>
is actually a metric in the mathematical sense, and can thus be used to
visualize the harmonic relationships in a scale. Moreover, harmonic
distances also facilitate the manual or automatic generation of
rationalizations of a given non-rational scale. Please see the author’s
<a
href="http://www.musikinformatik.uni-mainz.de/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a>
for a detailed account on the theory behind this.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>You need the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/agraef/pure-lang">Pure</a>, including
the Pure Tk and Octave modules.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.octave.org/">Octave</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl/Tk</a> and <a
href="https://dr-baum.net/gnocl/">Gnocl</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a>, including the Tcl
bindings.</li>
</ul>
<p>You probably need fairly recent versions of all these. Pure 0.44,
Octave 3.2.4, Tcl/Tk 8.5 (+ Gnocl 0.9.94g) and VTK 5.4.2 have been
tested and are known to work.</p>
<p>After installing all the dependencies, type <code>make</code> to
compile and <code>sudo make install</code> to install the scale program.
(This just copies the scale program to /usr/local/bin and the html
version of this manual to /usr/local/share/doc. You can specify an
alternative installation prefix with the <code>prefix</code>
variable.)</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The scale program reads and writes files in the <a
href="https://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">Scala</a> scale file
format. (The Scala file format is the de facto standard for musical
scale data. Please check the Scala website for details on Scala and its
big repository of scale files.) To open a scale (.scl) file, use the
<code>Open</code> button in the main window, or specify the file on the
command line, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>scale b12tone.scl</code></pre>
<p>The main window is divided into two panes, a notebook widget with the
<code>Graph</code>, <code>Scale</code> and <code>Metric</code> tabs in
the upper half, and a box with various entry fields, global parameter
values, a strip of buttons and a status line in the lower half. The
status line gives feedback during operations which may take a while to
complete (in particular, when drawing and rationalizing a scale). The
<code>Graph</code> tab displays a 3-dimensional rendering of the scale.
The <code>Scale</code> and <code>Metric</code> tabs have additional
related information about the scale points and the disharmonicity metric
of the scale.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The latest version of the scale program will
usually have the graph display in a separate window, which improves both
usability and portability of the program (if you want, you can change
this back by editing an option in the scale.tcl file). In this case, the
controls on the <code>Graph</code> tab can be found in the main window
instead.</p>
<p>Scales can be loaded and saved with the <code>Open</code> and
<code>Save</code> buttons at the bottom of the main window, see <a
href="#file-operations">File Operations</a> below for details. If you
load a plain Scala file, you will be prompted if you first want to draw
it. This is also needed to generate some useful information on the
<code>Scale</code> and <code>Metric</code> tabs, so you should answer
<code>Yes</code> there. You can also just enter a scale in Scala format
(ratios as p/q where p and q are positive integers, cent values as
nonnegative floating point values) in the upper entry field in the lower
half of the main window and then click the <code>Draw</code> button to
render the scale. Some already rendered examples are included in the scl
subdirectory in the sources, so have a look at those to get an idea how
this works.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>Graph</code> and <code>Metric</code> tabs will
only have interesting information if all scale points are rational; this
is required to compute the disharmonicity metric. In this case the scale
display shows an approximation of the harmonic distances of the scale
points in three-dimensional Euclidean space, computed using a
multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm (also described in the author’s
<a
href="http://www.musikinformatik.uni-mainz.de/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a>).
The necessary operations to create a rational scale from any input scale
are provided, see <a href="#rationalizing-a-scale">Rationalizing a
Scale</a> below.</p>
<p>To exit the program, click the <code>Quit</code> button at the right
end of the button strip (equivalently, you can also use the
<code>Alt-Q</code> keyboard shortcut), or just close the main window.
The <code>About</code> button in the lower part of the main window
(keyboard shortcut: <code>Alt-B</code>) shows some useful information
about the program, while the <code>Help</code> button (keyboard
shortcut: <code>Alt-H</code>) displays this manual in a web browser.</p>
<h2 id="file-operations">File Operations</h2>
<p>The file operations can be found in the button strip at the bottom of
the main window.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>New</code>, <code>Open</code>, <code>Save</code>: Creates a
new, loads an existing, or saves the current scale, respectively. With
the latter two commands you are prompted to enter a scale (.scl)
filename.</li>
<li><code>Revert</code>: Reverts to the most recently saved version of
the loaded scale. This provides a quick way to revert your changes after
editing the scale or experimenting with different scale
rationalizations.</li>
<li><code>Quit</code>: Exit the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are generally indicated using underlining in the
button texts. So, e.g., the <code>Open</code> command can be invoked
with <code>Alt-O</code>, <code>Save</code> with <code>Alt-S</code>,
etc.</p>
<p>As of version 0.2, the scale program can also save scales as binary
sysex (.syx) files in the <a
href="https://www.midi.org/specifications/midi1-specifications/midi-1-addenda/midi-tuning-updated">MIDI
Tuning Standard</a> (MTS) format, so that you can easily retune any
MTS-compatible synthesizer to a scale by just sending the corresponding
sysex file to it. Currently this only works with octave-based scales
which have exactly 13 scale points (including the base tone 1/1 and the
octave 2/1). The written sysex files follow the <em>MIDI Tuning
Scale/Octave Extensions</em>, please check the MTS documentation for
details.</p>
<p>To save a scale as a sysex file, simply invoke the <code>Save</code>
operation as usual. When prompted to enter the scale filename, edit the
filename so that it ends in the extension <code>.syx</code>, then press
<code>Save</code>. A special dialog will appear which allows you to
choose various MTS format options. Adjust these to your liking and press
<code>Save</code> again (you can also cancel the operation at this
point). The available MTS format options are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Realtime</code>: If this option is checked, a realtime sysex
message will be written, otherwise a non-realtime message. Note that in
either case, the tuning changes will take effect immediately if the
sysex file is sent to an MTS-capable synthesizer. However, realtime
messages will also affect already sounding notes, whereas non-realtime
messages only apply to new notes played after the message is sent.</li>
<li><code>Encoding</code>: This is a combobox which allows you to pick
the desired encoding of the MTS message. MTS octave tunings can be
encoded in either 1-byte or 2-byte format, meaning that each tuning
offset is represented as one or two bytes, respectively. This affects
both range and precision of the tuning offsets, please check the MTS
documentation for details. Usually it is a good idea to pick the 2-byte
encoding, since it offers a wider range (-100..+100 ct) and better
precision. However, if your synthesizer only supports the 1-byte
encoding, or if you are really concerned about transmission bandwidth
then it may be necessary to choose the 1-byte encoding instead. (Note
that 2-byte messages need roughly twice the size of 1-byte messages;
this may affect how quickly the messages are processed, although this is
rarely a problem with modern hardware any more).</li>
<li><code>Base</code>: This spinbox enables you to select the reference
tone of the tuning, given as the index of a scale point in the range
0..11. A value of 0 indicates that the base tone of the scale will be at
its nominal tuning (i.e., at a tuning offset of 0 ct). The spinbox
allows you to change this as needed. Most of the time, you will want to
choose the value 9 to have the 9th scale tone (which usually corresponds
to the chamber pitch A) at a tuning offset of 0 ct, so that A4 will be
exactly at 440 Hz; this shifts the other tuning offsets
accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, realtime messages and 2-byte encodings are enabled, and
the base tone is set to 9, which should be sensible defaults in most
cases.</p>
<p>Note that in order to actually use the resulting sysex files, you
need an MTS-compatible synthesizer. Unfortunately, the MIDI Tuning
Standard isn’t supported by many hardware synthesizers, so you’ll
probably have to use a software synthesizer instead. A good
MTS-compatible software synthesizer is <a
href="https://www.fluidsynth.org/">Fluidsynth</a> which uses SoundFonts
and has a nice graphical frontend called <a
href="https://qsynth.sourceforge.io">Qsynth</a>. It is available for
Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition, you’ll need a program which can read sysex files and
transmit them to the synthesizer. There are many such programs freely
available for different platforms, such as <a
href="https://github.com/Manuel-K/SimpleSysexxer">Simple Sysexxer</a> on
Linux and <a href="http://www.midiox.com/">Midi-Ox</a> on Windows. Also,
many MIDI sequencing programs have this capability.</p>
<h2 id="editing-the-scale">Editing The Scale</h2>
<p>At the bottom of the main window there are two entry fields. The
first field is for the scale itself, while the second one is for a short
plain text description of the scale. You can write anything in the
second field (you can also just leave it empty), but the scale data must
follow the Scala conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quotient in the form <code>p/q</code>, where <code>p</code> and
<code>q</code> are positive integer values, denotes an interval by its
frequency ratio, e.g.: <code>1/1</code> (unison), <code>3/2</code>
(fifth), <code>2/1</code> (octave), etc.</li>
<li>A nonnegative floating point value such as <code>0.0</code>,
<code>701.955</code> or <code>1200.0</code> denotes a Cent value
(percent of an equal-tempered semitone).</li>
</ul>
<p>No other values are allowed in this field. Different scale tones are
usually entered in ascending order, starting with the base tone
<code>1/1</code> or <code>0.0</code>, with whitespace in between. For
instance: <code>1/1 100.0 3/2 1200.0</code>. (Note that the base tone is
implicit in the Scala file format, so it is not actually stored in scale
files. That’s why even if you don’t enter the base tone it will be added
automatically.)</p>
<p>To the right of the scale entry field there’s another control, the
“weight threshold” spinbox which allows you to enter a harmonic distance
threshold used to render the scale graph in the <code>Graph</code> tab,
and to determine rational tuning alternatives in the <code>Scale</code>
view. You’ll have to adjust this value accordingly when drawing or
rationalizing a scale.</p>
<h2 id="the-graph-view">The Graph View</h2>
<p>Once a scale has been entered or loaded, you can draw it by pushing
the <code>Draw</code> button on the <code>Graph</code> tab. This
produces a graphical rendering of the scale. The graphical rendering is
also stored in the scale file when you save it. Next time you load this
file, the same graphical view is recreated automatically.</p>
<p>If the scale contains any Cent values, the graphical display is a
simple chain of the scale points in the order in which they are given.
If all scale points are rational, however, then you’ll see a proper
3-dimensional rendering of the scale, called a “harmonicity graph.” The
nodes of this graph are the scale points and the edges represent
color-coded harmonic distances between some pairs of scale points (see
below).</p>
<p>Note that the graphical rendering isn’t arbitrary, but approximates
the harmonic distances (shown on the <code>Metric</code> tab) between
scale points by their Euclidean distances in the drawing, so that it
becomes easy to analyse the harmonic relationships in the scale. This is
achieved using a technique called “multidimensional scaling” (MDS), see
the author’s <a
href="http://www.musikinformatik.uni-mainz.de/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a>
for details.</p>
<p>The graphical view can be rotated, panned and zoomed with the mouse,
so that you can take a look at the scale from all angles. To these ends,
press a mouse button in the graph window (left for rotation, middle for
panning, right for zooming) and, with the mouse button still pressed,
move the mouse cursor in any direction. Moving the mouse cursor with the
left or middle button pressed rotates or moves the view in the
corresponding direction. To zoom in and out, with the right mouse button
pressed move the mouse cursor up and down, respectively.</p>
<p>The following keyboard commands are recognized in the graphical
view:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>r</code>: Resets the view to the default camera position
(horizontal x and vertical y axis, with positive z coordinates in
front).</li>
<li><code>j</code>: Switches to an alternative “joystick” mode in which
you only have to press the left/right/middle mouse button inside the
view to rotate/pan/zoom.</li>
<li><code>t</code>: Switches back to the default “trackball” mode in
which you drag the mouse cursor with the left/right/middle mouse button
to rotate/pan/zoom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various controls for the display can be found in the strip at the
bottom of the <code>Graph</code> pane (or in the main window below the
<code>Scale</code>/<code>Metric</code> pane if the graph is shown in a
separate window):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Draw</code>: Updates the scale information and redraws the
scale. Progress will be shown in the progress bar in the main window (to
the right of the scale description field). You can run this as often as
you want, e.g., after editing the scale. Also, note that the MDS
algorithm starts from a random start embedding, so for some scales you
might get different renderings when you redraw the scale.</li>
<li><code>Reset</code>: Reset the camera position (same as the
<code>r</code> key in the graphical view, see above).</li>
<li><code>Axes</code>: Enables or disables x, y and z axes display in
the view.</li>
<li><code>Labels</code>: Enables or disables the node label display
which shows information about the scale points in the graph.</li>
<li><code>Node label type</code>: A combobox which lets you choose
between “Pitch” (show ratios or cent values; this is the default),
“Factors” (prime factors of ratios), “Cent” (cent values), “Note” (note
names, if known), “Interval” (interval descriptions, for known
intervals) and “Ordinal” (scale index). These items have the same
meaning as the corresponding columns on the <code>Scale</code> tab, see
<a href="#the-scale-view">The Scale View</a> below for details.</li>
<li><code>Weights</code>: Enables or disables the edge weight display,
which shows the harmonic distances between scale points.</li>
<li><code>Edge weight function</code>: A combobox which lets you choose
between various harmonic distance functions, currently: “Barlow”
(Barlow’s indigestability metric) and “Euler” (Euler’s gradus
suavitatis). The other functions are variations of these (the “/2”
versions set the harmonic distance of octaves to zero, and the “Log”
variations take the decadic logarithm of the Euler and Barlow metrics).
Changing the weight function produces different drawings and information
on the Scale and Metric tabs, so you’re prompted to redraw the scale
when changing this value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these, the already mentioned “weight threshold” spinbox to
the right of the scale entry field also influences the display of the
harmonicity graph. Only those edges between scale points will be drawn
whose harmonic distance does not exceed the value given in the spinbox.
Moreover, the edges are color-coded (blue denotes low, red high harmonic
distances).</p>
<h2 id="the-scale-view">The Scale View</h2>
<p>The <code>Scale</code> tab shows detailed information about the
current scale in the form of a table whose columns include the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Select</code>: This column allows you to select pitches for
the rationalization algorithm, see the comments below and <a
href="#rationalizing-a-scale">Rationalizing a Scale</a> for
details.</li>
<li><code>#</code>: Ordinal numbers (starting at zero = base tone).</li>
<li><code>Pitch</code>: The ratio or cent value, as given in the scale
entry field.</li>
<li><code>Factors</code>: The factorization of the pitch, if it is
rational.</li>
<li><code>Cent</code>: The corresponding cent value.</li>
<li><code>Weight</code>: The disharmonicity value of the interval (for
rational pitches only), as given by the weight function on the
<code>Graph</code> tab.</li>
<li><code>Note</code>: The note name, if available.</li>
<li><code>Interval</code>: The name of the interval from the Scala
intnam.par file, if available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note names are computed automatically from a factorization of the
ratios, assuming a “standard” tuning for the prime factors. At present,
this is only implemented for rational pitches with the prime factors 2,
3, 5, 7 and 11, i.e., for “11-limit” pitches. 1/1 always denotes the
base note C, and the other note names are computed relative to that.</p>
<p>The first column in the scale view allows you to select both scale
points and the corresponding tuning alternatives. Selected scale points
are considered “locked” for the purpose of scale rationalization. By
default, all scale points are selected which are rational already. Also,
for scale points for which alternative tunings are available, there is a
tiny arrowhead in this column. Clicking on the arrowhead symbol expands
the corresponding scale point and shows the available candidate
tunings.</p>
<p>You can also click on the column headers to sort the scale view based
on the values in the corresponding column. This is most useful for the
numeric columns (<code>#</code>, <code>Cent</code> and
<code>Weight</code>). By default, the table is ordered by ordinals
(<code>#</code>), meaning that the scale points are listed in the order
in which they are written in the scale entry field. Clicking on a column
title once sorts the table in ascending order. Clicking the same column
title again reverses the order so that the values in the column are
listed in descending order.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the <code>Scale</code> tab there is a strip with
operations and parameters for selecting scale points and alternative
tunings and controlling the rationalization algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Clear</code>: Deselect all scale points and alternative
tunings.</li>
<li><code>Select All</code>: Select all candidate tunings for which the
corresponding scale point is <em>not</em> selected (i.e.,
unlocked).</li>
<li><code>Refresh</code>: Refresh the scale display (in particular, this
updates the available candidate tunings). This is usually done after
changing the number of candidate tunings and tuning tolerance parameters
(see below) as well as the weight threshold parameter in the main
window.</li>
<li><code>Number of tuning alternatives</code>: A spinbox which allows
you to select the maximum number of alternative tunings to be shown for
each scale point.</li>
<li><code>Tuning tolerance</code>: Another spinbox with which you choose
the maximum tuning tolerance for the alternative tunings for each scale
point.</li>
<li><code>Rationalization heuristic</code>: This lets you choose between
different candidate tuning selection heuristics for the automatic
rationalization algorithm. The present implementation provides two
alternatives, “First” and “Best”.</li>
<li><code>Rationalize</code>: Automatic scale rationalization
algorithm.</li>
<li><code>Update</code>: After selecting some alternative tunings,
clicking this button updates and redraws the scale in the main window
accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these, the “weight threshold” spinbox to the right of the
scale entry field determines which tuning alternatives are shown for
each scale point. Only tuning alternatives with a disharmonicity value
of at most the threshold value are shown. Moreover, for each scale point
the table shows at most n tuning alternatives in the range c-tol …
c+tol, where c is the cent value of the scale point (as given in the
<code>Cent</code> column of the table), and tol and n are the tuning
tolerance and the number of tuning alternatives, as given by the
corresponding spinboxes.</p>
<p>The order of the alternative tunings for each scale tone depends not
only on their nominal disharmonicity values but also on their absolute
deviation from the scale point in cents. To these ends, the scale
program computes “weighted” disharmonicity values using a formula by
Barlow, described in the <a
href="http://www.musikinformatik.uni-mainz.de/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a>.
(The idea behind this is that the nominal disharmonicity values are
scaled using a Gaussian bell curve which has its center at the current
pitch of the scale point in Cents.) The first tuning alternative shown
for a scale point is thus the “best” rational approximation of the scale
tone according to this criterion, which is a compromise between
harmonicity and tuning accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="the-metric-view">The Metric View</h2>
<p>For rational scales, the <code>Metric</code> tab shows the harmonic
distance metric used in drawing and rationalizing a scale. It takes the
form of a matrix which shows for each pair x,y of scale points their
harmonic distance, i.e., the disharmonicity of the interval x/y between
the scale points. The weight function used to determine these values can
be chosen with the “edge weight function” combobox on the
<code>Graph</code> tab.</p>
<h2 id="rationalizing-a-scale">Rationalizing a Scale</h2>
<p>If a scale isn’t rational yet then it is not possible to analyze the
interval structure of a scale since this requires knowing the rational
relationships between the scale tones. On the <code>Scale</code> tab you
find the necessary tools to rationalize a scale using the following
methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Manual rationalization</em>: Here you simply select the desired
rational tuning alternatives for each scale tone and then use
<code>Update</code> to update the scale data and redraw the scale. You
can select more than one tuning alternative for each scale tone. In such
a case the first alternative will be chosen, depending on the current
order of the alternatives in the table. Thus the easiest way to quickly
obtain a rationalization is to just click <code>Select All</code> and
then <code>Update</code>.</li>
<li><em>Automatic rationalization</em>: This uses a clique search
algorithm on the harmonicity graph to determine a collection of selected
tuning alternatives (at most one per scale point) for which the mutual
harmonic distances do not exceed the bound given in the “weight
threshold” spinbox. The selection of the tuning alternatives is then
modified to reflect the computed solution. When done, just click
<code>Update</code> as with the manual method to update the scale using
the computed solution.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixing-parts-of-the-scale">Fixing Parts of the Scale</h3>
<p>With either method, selected scale points are considered
<em>locked</em>, i.e., they will not be modified by
<code>Rationalize</code> and <code>Update</code>. (However, the
automatic rationalization algorithm does take into account locked
<em>rational</em> scale points when computing the eligible tuning
alternatives.) By default, rational scale points are selected and thus
considered locked. If you want to re-rationalize these as well, you
first need to deselect them in order to unlock them. The quickest way to
do this is to click the <code>Clear</code> button which deselects all
scale points (as well as all tuning alternatives). Then use
<code>Select All</code> to select all tuning alternatives (or select the
ones that you want manually) before running <code>Rationalize</code>
and/or <code>Update</code>.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-rationalization">Automatic Rationalization</h3>
<p>The <code>Rationalize</code> command employs a backtracking clique
search algorithm which explores exponentially many possibilities in the
worst case and thus may be <em>very</em> slow, depending on the number
of available tuning alternatives. To deal with this, you may try to
restrict the number of tuning alternatives or fix some tunings manually
beforehand.</p>
<p>You can also just run the algorithm and interrupt it at any time by
hitting the <code>Rationalize</code> button (which is now labelled
<code>Interrupt</code>) again. The progress of the algorithm towards an
optimum solution which rationalizes all unlocked scale points is shown
in the progress bar in the main window. Usually, the algorithm will
converge to a local optimum pretty quickly (indicated by no further
changes in the progress bar), at which point you may interrupt the
algorithm and see whether the computed solution provides at least a
viable partial rationalization of the scale.</p>
<p>The rationalization algorithm can also be adjusted by employing
different search heuristics. You can find these in the Rationalization
heuristic` combobox. In the current program version, only two search
heuristics are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>First</code>: Scale points and tuning alternatives are
considered in the order in which they are shown in the table. This
strategy works pretty well if enough “good” candidate tunings are
available and is the default.</li>
<li><code>Best</code>: This strategy selects tuning alternatives
dynamically in order to minimize the total disharmonicity in the chosen
rationalization. This tends to produce overall better solutions, but is
slower than the <code>First</code> strategy and may also produce “funny”
tunings for some scale points at times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future versions of the program may add more search heuristics as we
find new ways to guide the search towards good solutions. But note that
the scale rationalization problem is inherently difficult (NP-hard in
computer science parlance, see the <a
href="http://www.musikinformatik.uni-mainz.de/schriftenreihe/nr45/scale.pdf">report</a>
for details) and thus no search heuristic can guarantee to find good
solutions quickly in all cases (unless P=NP, of course, but this is
considered very unlikely by most experts).</p>
<h3 id="performing-a-rationalization">Performing a Rationalization</h3>
<p>To summarize, here is an outline of the basic steps of the
rationalization process:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Make sure that the current scale is saved, so that you can easily
reload it and start over if things go awry.</li>
<li>Choose a weight threshold value (and possibly a tuning tolerance and
a number of tuning alternatives) and do a <code>Refresh</code> until a
suitable set of tuning alternatives is shown.</li>
<li>Select the scale points that you want to stay fixed, and deselect
the ones that you want to be rationalized. By default, all rational
scale points are selected already which is often a sensible choice, so
you can skip this step if you’re content with the default selection. You
can also use <code>Clear</code> if you want to just re-rationalize
everything.</li>
<li>Select the eligible tuning alternatives. Or just do
<code>Select All</code> to select all tuning alternatives. (This also
expands the corresponding scale points if necessary to show all selected
alternatives.)</li>
<li>Use <code>Rationalize</code> to try an automatic rationalization.
(Hit the same button again to interrupt it if it takes too long.) You
might need to increase the weight threshold and/or fine-tune the
selection of tuning alternatives to obtain a satisfactory result using
this method. (If you already selected some suitable tuning alternatives
that you want to use, you can also just skip this step and directly
proceed to step 5.)</li>
<li>Use <code>Update</code> to update the scale and redraw it.</li>
<li>If all scale tones are rational now then you’re done. Otherwise,
just repeat the steps 1-5 above until you’re satisfied with the
result.</li>
<li>If the solution you got is not what you wanted, just use
<code>Revert</code> to revert to the original version of the scale and
start over.</li>
</ol>
