While the interpreter is already useful as it is, there's still a lot of
things that remain to be done. Most important items, in no particular order:

- Symbolic (Pure-level) debugger, profiler. The necessary hooks are mostly
  there, we just need to add a few runtime calls in the generated code.

- Better error recovery in the parser (Schreiner/Friedman?). Currently uses
  panic mode (looking for ';') which is awful for syncing after an error
  because the ';' token can occur inside nested blocks ('with', 'when') etc.

- Add support for externals from languages with other calling conventions
  already fully supported by LLVM (Fortran, Ada?). A Q module adapter would
  also be useful, so that we can take advantage of the extensive set of
  system, GUI and multimedia libraries offered by Q. For well-behaved Q
  modules, the latter should work even without a resident Q interpreter, by
  just emulating the libq interface on the "Pure metal".

- Interactive 'dump' command to export the current program as an LLVM bitcode
  module which can then be compiled and linked (statically or dynamically)
  with other (C or Pure) modules. Likewise, offer a -c option which does the
  same from the command line. We should also provide special support for
  compiled Pure modules in the interpreter, so that these can be loaded and
  have their symbols automagically declared as externals.

- Multithreading support. This requires thread-local data instead of globals
  in a few places, and synchronization where interpreter globals are used
  (most notably, runtime compilation, symbol table, exception stack and
  expression memory management). We also need to add the necessary support
  functions to the runtime.

- Better support for proper tail calls. Currently this only works for direct
  calls. See the manpage for details.

- More aggressive optimizations (common subexpression elimination for "pure"
  a.k.a. side-effect-free function calls, etc.).

- Support for Wadler views (or similar).
