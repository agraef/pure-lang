2014-10-28  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* 0.64 release.

2014-10-24  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, runtime.cc/h: Add Perl regex support. This is
	still experimental and currently disabled by default, as it may
	alter the interpretation of certain constructs in regular
	expressions. Configuring with --with-pcre enables it in the
	runtime (this needs libpcreposix, see http://www.pcre.org/).

2014-10-23  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): As proposed by Alastair Pharo, use
	some linker magic in the batch compiler in order to locate
	imported libraries which can't be found by their name or under the
	Pure library path. Cf. ticket #30:
	https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/issue/30

2014-10-22  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* 0.63 release.

	* interpreter.cc: Integrate Barry Schwartz' support for inlining
	ATS (http://www.ats-lang.org/).

2014-09-23  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc: Bugfixes in Faust interface
	(consistent treatment of empty group and control labels across
	different Faust versions).

2014-09-15  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* 0.62 release.

	* pure.cc, interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc: Add llc -m code
	generation options for the batch compiler (experimental).

2014-09-10  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* 0.61 release.

	* configure.ac: Fixes in the build system when linking against the
	static LLVM libs (LLVM 3.5).

2014-09-09  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* More LLVM 3.5 compatibility fixes related to the batch compiler.
	LLVM 3.5 now has a new user_iterator class to iterate over the
	uses of variables and functions in an instruction; the old
	use_iterator class can't be used for that purpose any more.

	* interpreter.cc (interpreter::compiler): For LLVM 3.3 and later,
	let llc create native objects directly from the LLVM source. This
	should speed up compilation in the batch compiler and also work
	around bugs which make llc generate invalid native assembler code
	on some systems.

2014-09-08  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* LLVM 3.5 compatibility fixes

2014-03-24  Albert Gräf  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* 0.60 release.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc, etc/pure-mode.el.in,
	test/test020.pure: minor fixes for OS X compatibility.

2014-03-09  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* runtime.cc/hh: Add some helper functions to serialize accesses
	to the runtime, to be used if the runtime needs to be called from
	multithreaded C/C++ code. This essentially implements a global
	interpreter lock (GIL) which isn't nice, but can't really be
	avoided in some situations until the Pure runtime becomes fully
	thread-safe.

2014-03-02  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc: Keep track of global interpreter
	contexts, to make switching between interpreter instances more
	robust. Specifically, in batch-compiled modules there's only a
	single global instance of the sstk (shadow stack) and fptr
	(environment) variables, so we need to ensure that these aren't
	clobbered if multiple interpreter instances run in concert.
	Similar considerations apply to the static baseptr member which is
	used to check for stack overflows; in this case we also try to
	detect situations where the baseptr needs to be updated due to
	context switches.

2014-02-26  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* 0.59 release.

2014-01-08  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, interpreter.cc: Changes for LLVM 3.4 compatibility.

2013-09-16  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* 0.58 release.

	* runtime.cc (pure_invoke): Fix an obscure memory corruption bug
	which might cause temporaries to be freed prematurely. Fixes issue
	#7 reported by ebm_boy.

2013-09-13  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll, interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc: Added
	--symbolic/--nosymbolic pragmas, cf. issue #12. This compilation
	option allows you to set the interpreter's default mode to
	non-symbolic so that all global functions with rules are treated
	as "defined" functions (as with the --defined pragma). Note that
	this interferes with Pure's symbolic evaluation capabilities and
	thus the same caveats as for the --defined pragma apply.

	Please note that this feature is still highly experimental and a
	bit rough around the edges. For consistency, we also provide a
	--nosymbolic command line option and an equivalent PURE_NOSYMBOLIC
	environment variable, but it isn't really advisable to use these
	right now since they may break some standard library functions, as
	well as functions in other addon modules. But it's possible to use
	a pair of --nosymbolic and --symbolic pragmas to delineate
	sections of code in which all global functions are to be marked as
	--defined.

2013-09-11  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* printer.cc (pure_is_list): Detect cycles in lazy list structures
	to prevent looping in the expression printer. Fixes issue #6
	reported by ebm_boy.

2013-08-21  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* pure.cc, runtime.cc: Improvements in the command line syntax.
	The -x option is now optional, so that a script can be invoked
	with arguments simply as 'pure script args ...'. To invoke
	multiple scripts in batch mode you now have to specify the new -b
	option. Please check the manual for details.

2013-08-17  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in, parser.yy: Rework the checks for
	Bison 3.0. Instead of a configure time check, we now check for
	Bison 3.0 at compile time, when the parser is regenerated. This
	prevents miscompilation if Bison 3.0 is installed, but we use a
	pregenerated parser (built with Bison <3.0) while building.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in, interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Fixes for
	mingw64 compatibility.

	* config/config.guess, config/config.sub: Update to latest
	versions. Also apply the patch from
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/config-patches/2013-03/msg00000.html
	so that the proper architecture is detected on msys/mingw64
	systems.

2013-08-16  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Add code to detect Bison 3.0 and enable the
	corresponding workarounds in an automatic fashion (see below).

2013-08-15  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* lexerdefs.hh, lexer.ll, parser.yy: Work around some bugs in C++
	parser code generation of Bison 3.0.

2013-08-14  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* runtime.cc (matrix_scanl, matrix_scanr): Fix gcc 4.8 warnings.

	* configure.ac, interpreter.cc/hh: LLVM 3.3 compatibility fixes

2013-07-31  Albert Graef  <aggraef@gmail.com>

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/matrices.pure: Add conversion routines between
	numeric/bigint matrices and 64 bit integer vectors.

2013-02-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (macspecial): New built-in macros __dir__ and
	__file__ which return the directory and absolute filename of the
	current script, respectively.

2013-02-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (macspecial): __locals__ macro: Make sure that we
	exclude the calling function itself from the constructed
	environment, to prevent infinite recursion if the function happens
	to be a local parameterless function (which is a common idiom,
	especially when __locals__ gets invoked through the reduce macro).

2013-02-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in (uninstall): Only uninstall extra items (Emacs mode,
	TeXmacs plugin) if we're configured to install them.

	* pure.cc: Fix libedit support.

2013-02-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.57 release.

	* configure.ac: Improve the handling of build types
	(--enable-release et al) so that these may be combined with manual
	settings of the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS variables.

	* printer.cc (ptrstr): Make sure that pointer values are
	pretty-printed consistently across different C++ libraries, cf.
	http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/issues/detail?id=102.

	* configure.ac: Bump version (0.57).

2013-02-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* expr.hh, interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: C++0x/11 compatibility
	fixes. Fixes issue #102 reported by windoze.net, see
	http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/issues/detail?id=102.

2013-01-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Work around changed linker defaults
	on recent Linux systems.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Faust2 compatibility; changes in
	layout of MetaGlue data structure

2012-11-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.56 release.

	* configure.ac, interpreter.cc/hh: LLVM 3.2 compatibility.

2012-11-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_str): Alternative str() implementation which
	returns a Pure string instead of a raw C string. We use this in
	primitives.pure now to prevent the memory leaks resulting from
	calling str() directly from Pure.

	* util.cc (my_strdup, my_strfree): strdup/free replacements to
	reduce the number of temporary string allocations. This is still
	experimental.

	* interpreter.cc (compile_interface): Get rid of bogus warnings
	for abstract (unimplemented) interface types.
	(finalize_interface_rules): Fix detection of empty interfaces.
	This fixes issue #95.

	* lib/prelude.pure, lib/matrices.pure: Fixes to all, any, unzip
	(cf. issue #92 and #93). Also, smatrix accepts a dimension
	argument now like the other matrix construction functions
	(issue #96).

	* lib/primitives.pure: Improved simplifications of partially
	evaluated logical connectives. E.g., both 1&&x and x&&1 give x
	now.

2012-11-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* texmacs: Overhaul of TeXmacs plugin.

2012-10-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (reduce): Fixed a memory leak and resolved a rather
	obscure segfault due to global closures becoming invalidated by a
	recent recompile.

2012-10-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: TeXmacs completion support.

2012-10-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll, runtime.cc: Improved readline support: Add
	secondary command input, so that the debugger has its own command
	history.

2012-10-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure (n..m): Bugfix: For consistency with the
	n1:n2..m case, do a quick check that m-n yields a real value (this
	will fail if n and m don't belong to the same enumerated type,
	in which case we want to leave n..m as a normal form).

	* interpreter.cc (exec): Improvements in TeXmacs mode. The REPL
	now temporarily replaces __show__ with __texmacs__ in order to
	allow for custom pretty-printing of expressions in TeXmacs
	mode. (Note that simply redefining __show__ may break applications
	which rely on print representations returned by the `str`
	function.)

2012-10-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Rename break, trace to __break__, __trace__
	to prevent naming conflicts. While `break` isn't likely to occur
	in user code, `trace` is commonly used, e.g., as a matrix
	operation.

2012-10-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/texmacs: Added TeXmacs/LaTeX template contributed by
	Kurt Pagani.

2012-09-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Use a reasonable default for the advisory stack
	limit so that stack checks are always done by default.

2012-09-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/matrix_inversion.pure: Added matrix inversion example
	by Rob Hubbard, ported from Q to Pure by Jiri Spitz.

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Add -h (help) option to the del, trace and run
	commands.

2012-09-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/*: Add new break and trace builtins to keyword tables.

	* lib/primitives.pure: New break and trace builtins (see below).

	* runtime.cc/h: New pure_break() and pure_trace() primitives.
	These trigger debugging and tracing when called from a Pure
	program with debugging enabled.

2012-09-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/lu.pure: Example contributed by Johannes Engels.

	* interpreter.hh (interpreter), interpreter.cc (exec), lexer.ll
	(lex_input), runtime.cc (pure_debug_rule), pure.cc (main): Add
	minimal support for texmacs (http://www.texmacs.org/), per request
	by Kurt Pagani (issue #89).

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Add a pure-send-yank command which allows
	to send lines from the kill ring to the interpreter. This works in
	both pure-mode and pure-eval-mode. Also added a new
	pure-send-skip-prompts flag (enabled by default). This causes the
	send commands to preprocess input which looks like a session
	transcript containing both command prompts and results, by
	removing prompts and skipping non-command lines. This is
	convenient, in particular, to send samples of interpreter
	interactions from the online documentation.

2012-09-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure, lib/primitives.pure: Declare 'true' and
	'false' as nonfix symbols so that they can be used in patterns.
	Also add a 'bool' type along with a corresponding 'boolp'
	predicate for normalized truth values (0 and 1), and a 'bool'
	function to convert machine integers to normalized truth values.

2012-09-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Adjust the __do__ macro for generator clauses
	involving patterns (see below).

	* interpreter.cc (mklistcomp_expr, mkmatcomp_expr): Add the
	necessary magic to make comprehensions involving patterns filter
	out unmatched generator values automatically, as it is in Haskell.

2012-09-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/enum.pure: New enum.pure module which provides some
	convenience functions to facilitate the creation of enumeration
	types. Experimental.

2012-09-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure (..): Fix some glitches in the generic
	arithmetic sequences with step size, so that they work with
	general enumerated types.

2012-09-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc (main): Spiffy new logo for the sign-on message. You can
	disable this with the --plain option or by setting the PURE_PLAIN
	environment variable, if you prefer the old sign-on message.

2012-08-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy: Uncaught exceptions of mklistcomp_expr/mkmatcomp_expr
	in parser (fixes issue #88 reported by kp@scios.ch).

2012-08-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Cosmetic changes to the parsing of special command
	syntax (fixes issue #84).

2012-08-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (build_map): 'case' needs a separate FMap root
	for each rule so that the call to FMap::select() in try_rules()
	does the right thing (fixes issue #87 reported by Jim Pryor).

2012-07-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc, pure.cc, lexer.ll: Integrated a
	patch by Jim Pryor (with modifications) which allows the escape
	mode command prefix to be specified with the --escape option and
	the PURE_ESCAPE environment variable. Thanks Jim!

2012-07-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* printer.cc (printx): Bugfix in pretty-printer: Type tags must be
	padded with whitespace if compile time expressions are printed
	with deBruijn annotations (-v2). Otherwise the pretty-printed code
	won't be reparsed correctly, since x/*...*/::y will be parsed as
	x ::y rather than x :: y.

	This bug affected, in particular, test/special.pure. Many of the
	other golden test logs were also updated accordingly.

2012-07-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, parser.yy, interpreter.cc/hh, symtable.cc/hh:
	Implemented namespace brackets, based on an idea by Yann Orlarey.
	This makes it much more convenient to use embedded domain-specific
	sublanguages in Pure. For instance, you may now write something
	like:

	outfix « »;
	namespace faust (« »);

	This means that the namespace 'faust' can now be accessed on the
	fly in expressions like «(a,b,c) : (sin,cos,tan)». The
	subexpression inside the namespace brackets is then parsed by
	temporarily switching to the corresponding namespace. The
	namespace brackets themselves must be a pair of outfix symbols
	which has been declared already, and are removed from the
	resulting expression. This works pretty much like a 'namespace'
	declaration, but only gives access to the public symbols of the
	namespace, and can be used anywhere inside an expression (even on
	the left-hand side of a rule). Nesting these constructs is also
	possible.

	Also, to accommodate these changes, the declaration syntax is now
	slightly more liberal in that qualified symbols are permitted in
	symbol and namespace declarations. (In the case of symbol and
	'using namespace' declarations, it will also be checked that
	qualified symbols are declared in or imported from the proper
	namespace.) This allows you to write stuff like:

	namespace faust with outfix faust::begin faust::end; end;
	namespace faust (faust::begin faust::end);

	which isn't possible without using namespace qualifiers because
	'end' by itself is a reserved keyword in Pure.

2012-06-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Bugfixes and improvements in the interactive
	command parser. In particular, clear, dump and show will now
	complain about undefined symbols. This doesn't detect unmatched
	glob patterns and so isn't 100% foolproof, but it should catch
	most common errors and typos.

2012-06-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc: Add -e/--escape option and PURE_ESCAPE environment
	variable to switch on new escaped command syntax. Also fix up
	command completion accordingly.

	* lexer.ll, interpreter.cc/hh: Add support for escaped command
	syntax, as discussed on the mailing list. If this option is
	enabled, all interactive commands are prefixed with '!'. (This
	only applies to the command line, evalcmd works as before.)

2012-06-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/msort.pure: Added merge sort example by Jim Pryor.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* interpreter.cc (macspecial), symtable.cc/hh: Add a new built-in
	__gensym__ macro, per request by Jim Pryor. This enables you to
	create new, unqualified symbols on the fly, which is useful if a
	macro needs to generate block constructs such as lambdas and
	when/with clauses from scratch.

2012-06-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/matrices.pure: Experimental: As suggested by Jim Pryor, add
	non-splicing vector brackets as a shorthand notation for nested
	vectors.

	* runtime.cc (hash): Include environment in closure hashes (fixes
	second part of issue #82).

2012-06-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/do.pure: Add __do__ macro example from the Macros
	section of the manual.

	* runtime.cc (hash): Bogus assertion for anonymous closure (fixes
	issue #82 reported by Jim Pryor).

2012-06-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure.ssh: Added Eddie Rucker's a2ps style sheet for Pure.

2012-06-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (quoted_tag): Missing "as" pattern in quoted
	pattern (fixes issue #79 reported by Jim Pryor).

2012-06-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (macspecial): Leave the cases of __lambda__,
	__case__, __when__ and __with__ with an empty list argument
	undefined by the built-in macro rules (fixes issue #78 reported by
	Jim Pryor).

	* interpreter.cc (const_defn, clearsym): Make sure that we
	allocate a fresh expression pointer for each constant value cached
	in a read-only variable. This will leak a tiny amount of memory
	each time such a constant is redefined (which is possible using
	interactive commands and the introspection facilities), but this
	is needed to keep any dangling references to the constant intact.
	This fixes issue #77.

2012-06-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (get_funptr): get_funptr() might be invoked after a
	function was already purged from the environment.

2012-06-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (checkfuns): Remove bogus assertion (issue #75).
	(next_statem): Missing case in code generation for matrix matching
	(issue #76). Reported by Jim Pryor.

2012-06-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.55 release.

	* interpreter.cc: Make clang and gfortran -fdragonegg the default
	compilers for inlined C/C++/Fortran code, as llvm-gcc isn't
	supported in the LLVM 3.x series any more.

2012-06-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* configure.ac, interpreter.cc: Add some options to deal with
	systems such as Mac OSX and Ubuntu which may have the LLVM
	toolchain and configure script installed under different prefixes,
	so that several LLVM versions can coexist on the same system.

	First, the configure option --with-tool-prefix allows to specify
	the prefix for the LLVM toolchain. This option, if specified, is
	also used to locate the llvm-config script, so that the proper
	LLVM version is selected.

	Second, the --with-llvm-version option allows to set the desired
	LLVM version, in which case configure tries to locate the
	llvm-config-<version> script on the PATH (after trying the tool
	prefix, if specified). If this option isn't specified, we default
	to looking for the llvm-config script on the PATH, which matches
	the behaviour in previous releases.

	If none of these yield a usable llvm-config script, we fall back
	to trying llvm-config-<version> for recent LLVM versions,
	preferring the latest version if found. Otherwise we give up and
	print an error message.

2012-06-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh: Bugfix in type name resolution. Reported by
	Lucas Paul. Fixes issue #71.

2012-05-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Debian support: Add Debian packaging and a corresponding goal in
	the Makefile.

2012-05-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.54 release.

	* interpreter.cc (funsubstw): Fix clobbering of qualified symbols
	in the global namespace.

2012-05-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fix up regression in optimization rules for
	list slices introduced in Pure 0.49. Reported by Yann Le Du.

2012-05-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Version bump.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc, pure.cc: LLVM 3.1 compatibility
	fixes.

2012-03-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.53 release.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sort): As suggested by Peter Summerland,
	optimize the case of POD types (int, bigint, double, string) in
	conjunction with the standard (<) and (>) predicates. In this case
	we don't actually have to invoke the Pure predicates, but can just
	execute the comparisons directly in C++. With int lists this gives
	a 10x speedup.

2012-03-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Add -r and -s options to the trace command to switch
	between the new recursive and the previous skip tracing mode (see
	below).

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc: Fix up function and macro call
	tracing to allow for recursive tracing of reductions while a
	tracepoint was invoked. Make this the default, as it's more useful
	in most situations.

2012-03-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.52 release.

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Add a -a option to the trace command which
	sets tracepoints on all (global) symbols.

2012-03-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in: Fix a glitch causing discrepancies between
	generated log and actual test log for the prelude.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fix up the definition of the __do__ macro for
	the reworked treatment of macro arguments.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, lexer.ll: Fixed some of the bad side-effects
	of autoquoting of macro arguments which would break macro hygiene.

	Implicit quoting of macro arguments is now disabled by default,
	and can be selectively enabled for individual macros with the new
	--quoteargs pragma. Also, autoquoted macro parameters are now
	actually quoted, i.e., embedded macro calls are not evaluated.

	This fixes name capture issues due to premature evaluation of
	embedded macros in quoted macro arguments. One minor defect which
	remains is the case of a free variable in a macro substition being
	captured by a local definition if the entire construct is quoted;
	see the last example in test078.pure. (One might argue, though,
	that in this specific case the behaviour of the macro evaluator is
	actually correct.)

2012-03-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Update for the latest Faust revision after cleanup
	of the Faust UI data structures.

2012-02-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (lcsubst): Added a missing recursion in the
	conditional, lambda, case, when and with cases. This fixes a
	failed assertion in the bind() method which could also occur, in
	particular, when processing comprehensions on the left-hand side
	of an equation or lambda. Reported by Richard Grossman.

2012-01-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy: Refactor some grammar rules so that some types of
	syntax errors in toplevel constructs are caught a bit earlier (see
	issue #69 reported by Jiri Spitz).

2011-12-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.51 release.

	* interpreter.cc: Bugfixes in macro substitution involving 'when'
	expressions (fallout from changes in when_codegen 2011-11-25).

2011-12-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc/h: Add a new faust_load() runtime
	function which makes it possible to load a Faust dsp directly,
	without using eval (which isn't available in batch-compiled
	programs). Also fixed a bug in the Faust bitcode loader which
	would make it segfault in case of an existing but invalid Faust
	bitcode file.

2011-12-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.50 release.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Add a --main option to the batch
	compiler which allows to set the name of the main entry point of
	the compiled module. This allows different batch-compiled modules
	to coexist in the same program.

2011-12-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/bitcode/myinterp.pure: New example which illustrates
	how to create and use a secondary interpreter instance in Pure.

2011-12-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (inline_code): Add FAUST_OPT environment variable
	to allow optimization of inline Faust code. This is to be set to
	something like '| opt -O3'. Also add the -cn option with the Faust
	module name as argument to the Faust command of the inline compiler.

2011-12-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc, lib/faustui.pure: Add support for metadata in Faust
	control groups.

2011-12-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc, lib/faustui.pure: Add support for controller
	metadata in Faust dsps. To these ends, controls are now
	represented in the form 'f ref meta initargs', where the
	additional 'meta' argument is a list of key=>val string pairs.

	* interpreter.cc (bctype_name): Make gsl_matrix type detection
	work with dragonegg.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc/h: Add support for retrieving the
	global metadata of Faust dsp classes.

2011-12-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, interpreter.cc/hh: New conditional --ifdef and
	--ifndef pragmas. Also change the way that compilation options are
	initialized using PURE_OPTION environment variables.

2011-12-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc, interpreter.cc: Add custom hashing of tagged
	pointers. Reported by Peter Summerland.
	(hash): Added missing matrix cases. Reported by Peter Summerland.

2011-12-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_force): Plugged a memleak in recursive
	pure_force() calls. Reported by Stephan Rudlof.

2011-12-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (LoadFaustDSP): Proper cleanup for all globals in
	Faust modules when a module gets reloaded.

2011-11-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (compile_interface): Optimize away superflous
	candidate patterns which are subsumed by other interface patterns.

	* interpreter.cc (LoadFaustDSP, compiler): Bugfixes in the bitcode
	linker. Make sure that external function declarations and internal
	Faust functions are never stripped from batch-compiled code. Also
	make sure that old code for internal Faust functions gets cleaned
	before reloading a Faust module.

2011-11-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (when_codegen): Optimization of non-binding
	'when' clauses. This eliminates superflous environments and
	function calls for clauses of the form 'when x end' where x is
	just an expression. These now just compute x, then throw it away
	immediately, just like the $$ operator.

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Have #! (shebang) treated as preprocessor
	lines rather than comments, so that they aren't skipped by the
	movement and pure-send-line commands. Also, make pure-send-line
	skip over multi-line comments (if you really want to send such a
	comment to the interpreter, you can use pure-send-defun for that
	now; this will send the entire comment at once).

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/h, lib/primitives.pure: Add
	get_interface_typedef() operation.

2011-11-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Add --rewarn, --rewarn2 pragmas which reset the
	corresponding warning options to their defaults.

2011-11-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, expr.cc/hh, parser.yy: Lots of cosmetic
	changes and bugfixes in the interfaces implementation. Also
	improved the diagnostics (-w).

2011-11-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/h, lib/primitives.pure: Add meta
	operations for managing interfaces from Pure.

	* etc/*: Add new 'interface' keyword to the language modes.

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Add new 'interface' keyword to the keyword
	table. Add type symbols to the completion table.

	* lexer.ll: Add 'show interface' command.

	* expr.cc/hh, interpreter.cc/hh, lexer.ll, parser.yy: Add basic
	implementation of interface types (experimental).

2011-11-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Resolve type aliases at compile time as far as
	possible, so that the best possible matching code can be
	generated.

	* interpreter.cc: New read-only interactive and debugging options
	for conditional compilation.

2011-11-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version.

	* lib/primitives.pure: The rlist type can now be defined in a
	straightforward way.

	* interpreter.cc (try_rules): Implement tail call elimination on
	simple recursive type definitions.

2011-11-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.49 release.

2011-11-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh: Integrate code generation options (--checks
	et al) with the new conditional compilation pragmas, so that they
	can be set with --enable, --disable and queried with --if,
	--ifnot.

2011-11-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure, lib/matrices.pure: Add some conditional
	pragmas so that various kinds of optimization rules in the prelude
	can be disabled if the user wants to do that.

	* pure.cc, pure_norl.cc, runtime.cc: Add --enable and --disable
	command line options.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, lexer.ll: Add conditional compilation pragmas
	--enable, --disable, --if, --ifnot, --else, --endif.

	* lib/matrices.pure: Add some experimental optimization rules for
	vector et al, which make them use vectorseq et al to create
	vectors of int and double values from arithmetic seqences in an
	efficient way. (This is similar to the slices optimization in that
	it prevents the construction of an intermediate list value, which
	saves memory and speeds up things considerably for large vectors.)

2011-11-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure, lib/strings.pure, lib/matrices.pure: Add some
	experimental optimization rules for slices with contiguous int
	ranges, so that we don't actually construct the index list any
	more. This speeds up slices considerably and can also save
	substantial amounts of memory, especially in the matrix case.

2011-11-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/avltrees.pure, lib/dict.pure, lib/set.pure: Some bugfixes
	and optimizations in the comparison operations. Also, as discussed
	on the mailing list, we now fall back to syntactic equality of
	values in dictionary operations if semantic equality isn't
	defined.

2011-10-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/h: Add interpreter-local storage,
	exposed by means of the pure_interp_key(), pure_interp_set() and
	pure_interp_get() functions in the runtime. This allows
	applications to keep track of static data which depends on the
	particular interpreter instance, such as symbols and Pure
	expression data. The interface is similar to the POSIX
	thread-local storage functions (pthread_key_create and friends).

2011-10-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.hh, runtime.cc/h: Add a pointer equality callback,
	so that tagged pointer types can hook into same() and the null
	check for pointers.

2011-10-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, symtable.cc/hh: Add a new built-in __list__
	macro. This expands a tuple to a list, preserving embedded tuples
	in the same way that list values are parsed. This is provided for
	the benefit of custom aggregate notations (usually outfix
	operators) which are supposed to be parsed like the built-in list
	and matrix brackets. Note that there's no way to actually define
	this macro in Pure, so it is provided as a builtin instead.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

2011-10-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* INSTALL: Slight reorganization of the installation manual, to
	make it easier to link to various subsections from the wiki and
	elsewhere. Also added a note about ready-made packages now being
	available on FreeBSD.

2011-10-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.48 release.

	* interpreter.cc (inline_code): Add experimental DragonEgg
	support.

2011-10-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc: LLVM 3.0
	compatibility fixes.

2011-10-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc/h, lib/primitives.pure: Add a
	function lasterrpos to give more detailed error information about
	a failed val, eval or evalcmd operation. Per request by Peter
	Summerland.

2011-10-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: As suggested by John Cowan, add a --bigint pragma
	which, if enabled, causes all integer literals in the source to be
	interpreted as bigint values. This feature is still somewhat
	broken and thus not enabled by default. If you want to try it
	anyway, define USE_BIGINT_PRAGMA in lexer.ll at build time.

2011-10-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Make the --eager, --required and --(no)defined pragmas
	accept any kind of symbol (not just an identifier), so that they
	can be applied to special operator symbols. No checking is done on
	the syntax, and a following line comment (// ...) must be set off
	from the symbol with whitespace. Note that any of these options
	implicitly declare the symbol if necessary, so if the symbol is to
	be declared using special properties such as fixity, that
	declaration must come *before* any pragma involving the symbol.

	* lexer.ll, interpreter.cc: Implemented --defined and --nodefined
	pragmas, as discussed on the mailing list. These take a global
	function symbol as parameter and mark or unmark it as a "defined"
	symbol, respectively. If a symbol that is marked as "defined" is
	defined as a function in the Pure program, then the compiler
	generates special code which ensures that each application of the
	function actually reduces to something else. Otherwise, instead of
	returning a normal form, a 'failed_match' exception will be raised.
	The --defined status of a function can be changed at any time,
	causing the function to be recompiled on the fly. The --nodefined
	pragma restores the default behaviour of returning a normal form
	upon failure.

2011-10-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Add a special case rule so that double constants like
	1e100 are properly recognized.

	* lib/regex.pure: Move regex support into a separate module which
	can be loaded independently of the system module.

	* lib/system.pure: Improved printf/scanf implementation which
	supports GMP/MPFR (%Zd, %Rg) conversions.

2011-10-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in: Bump runtime library version.

	* configure.ac: Add MPFR checks.

	* runtime.cc/h: Add GMP/MPFR printf/scanf support to the runtime.

2011-10-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/pointers.pure: Moved pointer arithmetic into separate
	module, as suggested by Max Wolf.

2011-10-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.hh, runtime.cc/h, printer.cc: Add light-weight
	support for pretty printing of tagged pointer values. This adds
	another way to hook into the expression pretty-printer in order to
	define custom unparsing of opaque C/C++ data structures from C/C++
	code.

2011-10-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Add support for --warn/--nowarn pragmas, as suggested
	by Peter Summerland.

2011-09-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh: Implement __locals__ as a built-in macro (rather
	than subsituting it away at code generation time) so that proper
	lambda lifting is performed on the local function references.

2011-09-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Changed the keybindings for the block
	traversal commands to use the Meta prefix. (This used to be
	Ctrl+Shift, but this interferes with the standard binding for the
	shifted word movement commands for selecting ranges of text in cua
	mode.)

	Also, pure-mark-defun (C-M-h) and pure-send-defun (C-c C-f) now
	allow you to mark or send an inline code section (%< ... %>), if
	point is at or inside such a section.

2011-06-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (macspecial): Add a __namespace__ macro which
	expands to the current namespace at the point of the call, as a
	string.

2011-05-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (LoadFaustDSP): Add dsp::samplingFreq interface
	routine to retrieve the sampling rate of a Faust dsp.

	* runtime.cc (faust_method): Add primitive to retrieve the
	interface operations of a Faust dsp. This is also available under
	the name dsp_fun in lib/faustui.pure.

2011-05-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* runtime.cc (clear_lasterr): Add a routine to have lasterr()
	cleared.

	* interpreter.cc/hh (interpreter::logging), runtime.cc/h
	(pure_start_logging, pure_stop_logging): Add a logging facility
	for error messages and warnings from the compiler.

	This is still experimental and not exposed in the Pure library
	right now. It is intended to be used by modules compiling Pure
	source, so that they can have messages logged and later retrieved
	with lasterr(), in order to display the messages to the user in
	any desired way.

2011-04-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Experimental __func__ builtin which yields the
	lexically enclosing function (named closure or lambda). As
	suggested by Saptarshi Guha on the mailing list.

2011-04-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, interpreter.cc/hh: LLVM 3.0(svn) compatibility
	fixes.

2011-03-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.47 release.

2011-03-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* run-tests.in: Don't run test/special.pure by default, since it
	returns slightly different results depending on whether it is run
	on 32 or 64 bit systems. You can still run the test manually from
	the main source directory using the command './run-tests
	test/special.pure'.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Use settings of CC and CXX
	environment variables when compiling and linking native
	executables with 'pure -c'. Patch contributed by Zhihao Yuan
	(issue #53).

2011-03-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Fix up broken indentation if the semicolon
	terminating a definition comes after 'end' (reported by Eddie
	Rucker). Also fix up block indentation in parenthesized
	expressions.

2011-03-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* test/special.pure: Add a comprehensive test for the quoted
	special / built-in macro machinery. This uses most function
	definitions from the standard library as rule material and thus
	should guarantee that the reflection features are in good working
	order.

2011-03-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Missing substitution of quoted specials in
	'when', 'with' and 'case', reported by Eddie Rucker.

2011-03-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_create_interp): Enter first definitions level
	after sourcing scripts.

2011-02-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_debug_rule): The '!' debugger command now
	escapes an interpreter command rather than a shell command. (Use
	'!!' to escape a shell command.) In particular, this makes it
	possible to change breakpoints while in the debugger.

2011-02-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Add as simple facility which allows the user to define
	his own interactive commands. The commands are implemented by
	public functions in the special __cmd__ namespace which are
	invoked with one string argument (the rest of the command line,
	with leading and trailing whitespace trimmed off). If the command
	function returns a string, it is printed on stdout, followed by a
	newline. If the command throws a string, the string is interpreted
	as an error message which is printed in the usual 'cmd: message'
	format. Otherwise, nothing is printed.

	A user-defined command may override a built-in command with the
	same name; in this case it is possible to escape the built-in
	command by prefixing it with '^'. This is useful, in particular,
	if a customized command invokes the corresponding builtin via
	evalcmd.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Add operations
	to insert rewriting rules at a given rule (add_fundef_at et al).

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Add operations
	to delete rewriting rules, variables and constants (del_fundef et
	al).

2011-02-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Move globsym operation into prelude, add
	clearsym operation.

	* interpreter.cc: Add operations to retrieve and change the
	definitions of global variables and constants.

	* runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Add operations get_vardef,
	get_constdef and add_vardef, add_constdef to complement
	get_fundef, add_fundef et al.

	* interpreter.cc (csubst): If constant folding is enabled,
	eliminate conditionals whose value is known at compile time.

2011-02-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Improved optimization rules for "throwaway"
	list and matrix comprehensions which recurse into embedded
	generator and filter clauses.

2011-02-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, interpreter.cc: Allow multiple left-hand sides in
	macro definitions.

	* interpreter.cc, lexer.ll: Add a -m option to the 'trace' and
	'del' commands so that macro evaluations can be traced.

2011-02-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Add a globsym function which uses 'evalcmd
	"show"' to list defined symbols matching a given glob pattern and
	temp level.

2011-02-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Add operations to retrieve and change the
	definitions of global functions, types and macros.

	* runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Add operations get_fundef,
	get_typedef, get_macdef and add_fundef, add_typedef, add_macdef to
	give access to the above in the library.

2011-02-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Add a helper function __str__ to
	pretty-print quoted specials in runtime expression data. This is
	intended to be used with __show__.

2011-02-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Add experimental support for quoted specials. A
	term such as '(\x->x+1) will now yield a special term such as
	__lambda__ [x] (x+1) (which is actually a quoted application of a
	built-in macro such as __lambda__) which can be passed around and
	manipulated freely at both compile and run time. When evaluated,
	the macro reconstructs the corresponding special. This works with
	all kinds of special expressions (i.e., conditionals, lambdas,
	'case', 'when' and 'with' expressions). Moreoever, specials can
	now be used as patterns on the left-hand side of a rule to match a
	corresponding (quoted) special. See test061.pure for some
	examples.

2011-02-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* matcher.cc, interpreter.cc, et al: Implement matrix
	patterns. You can now use patterns like {x,y}, {x::int,y},
	{x,y;z,t}, or even nested matrix patterns like {{x,y},z} (which
	are matched literally) on the left-hand side of a rule. Note that
	in any case, variables match only single elements (not rows or
	columns), and thus the subject term must have exactly the same
	shape as the pattern in order to match; non-rectangular patterns
	like {x,y;z} cause an error message from the compiler.

2011-02-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Rename 'listp' to 'rlistp', 'listnp' to
	'listp', as discussed on the mailing list. Also rename the
	corresponding types, and fix up the library sources accordingly.

	* lib/primitives.pure, lib/matrices.pure, lib/math.pure: Add a
	bunch of type definitions for common value types like numbers,
	lists, tuples, matrices, closures, etc. Also renamed 'atomp' to
	'symbolp' and added a 'symbol' type for it.

2011-02-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_typecheck): Give at least some warnings at
	runtime if a type predicate wasn't defined before being used.

	* interpreter.cc (mksym_expr): Disable support for old-style type
	tags, so that we can properly support recursive type definitions
	without getting silly warnings. Note that this means that you'll
	have to fix up any remaining old-style custom tags of the form
	x::tag by rewriting it as an "as" pattern of the from x@(tag _).

	* lib/array.pure, lib/heap.pure, lib/dict.pure, lib/set.pure: Fix
	up the container types for the new type tags. Type names are all
	lowercase now.

2011-01-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, interpreter.cc: Allow empty rhs in type
	definition. This indicates either a forward declaration ('type
	foo;') or an implicit 'true' ('type foo (bar _);').

2011-01-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runetime.cc: Add support for the runtime type
	information necessary to make the new type predicates work with
	batch compilation.

2011-01-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (typep), lib/primitives.pure: Add a generic
	type-checking predicate.

	* interpreter.cc (add_type_rule), runtime.cc (pure_typecheck): Add
	support for type aliases.

	* symtable.cc/hh: Add predefined type symbols.

	* interpreter.cc, lexer.ll, parser.yy, etc.: Add basic
	infrastructure for type predicates (new 'type' definition), which
	is slated to replace the existing user-defined type tags. As
	discussed on the mailing list.

2011-01-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Add support for hideshow mode (code
	folding).

2011-01-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Fixes for LLVM 2.9svn
	compatibility.

2011-01-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, lexer.ll: Add limited support for extern varargs
	functions (... syntax). Also fixed some bugs in the matrix ->
	pointer conversions-

2011-01-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Add commands to navigate, mark and send
	defuns (Pure definitions and declarations).

2011-01-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Check if emacs is installed and, if
	so, byte-compile and install pure-mode.el automatically.

2011-01-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, etc/pure-mode.el.in: Change the inline code section
	delimiters to %< ... %>. This makes it possible to properly
	support them in pure-mode (where they are now treated as special
	types of comments) and avoids syntactic ambiguities (note that '%{'
	is legal Pure syntax; it could denote a % operator followed by a
	matrix value).

2011-01-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Various bugfixes and improvements. In
	particular, the indentation style ("hanging" indent for equations)
	can now be controlled with pure-indent-equals (this setting is
	independent of pure-align-equals). If this variable is set to nil,
	hanging indent is disabled and the right-hand sides of equations
	are indented relative to the enclosing block instead.

	There's a new customizable variable pure-electric-keys which
	determines whether "electric keys" such as ';' and '=' should do
	auto-indentation and alignment. Note that if this variable is nil
	then pure-align-equals doesn't have any effect either.

	In addition to ';' and '=', the common paren symbols ('(', ')',
	'[', ']', '{', '}') now also have electric-key functionality.

	The corresponding flags (pure-indent-equals, pure-align-equals and
	pure-electric-keys) can now be controlled on a per-buffer basis
	and the corresponding settings are shown in the modeline ("i", "a"
	and "e" indicators). For convenience, the commands to toggle these
	settings now also have keyboard bindings (C-c M-i, C-c M-a and C-c
	M-e) in Pure mode.

	The pure-debug-mode setting is now also shown on the pure-eval
	modeline.

	Inline code sections %{...%} are now given special treatment in
	fontification and indentation.

	The default setting for pure-histfile was changed to
	~/.emacs-pure-history so that it doesn't interfere with the
	command line interpreter.

2011-01-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Add automatic indentation (TAB), electric
	delimiters ('=', ';') and paragraph fill (M-q) for comments and
	strings. These can be customized in various ways, see the online
	documentation of Pure mode (C-h m in Emacs) for details.

2011-01-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in (pure-run): Add a customizable variable for
	the stack size (PURE_STACK environment variable).

	* Makefile.in: Add rules for byte-compiling pure-mode.el and
	installing both pure-mode.el and pure-mode.elc in the Emacs
	site-lisp directory.

2011-01-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Bugfixes and many cosmetic changes to menus
	and keybindings. Also added a pure-eval command which evaluates a
	Pure expression read from the minibuffer and prints the result in
	the echo area or inserts it into the current buffer.

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Add -b and -t option to 'del' command, so that
	we can selectively delete breakpoints or tracepoints only. (By
	default, 'del' deletes both break- and tracepoints.)

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: More bugfixes and improvements, added
	pure-break and pure-trace commands to set break- and tracepoints.

2011-01-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Add a global flag to enable debugging
	mode (-g) in the Pure interpreter, which can be toggled with the
	pure-toggle-debug-mode command. Removed obsolete pure-debug-script
	command. Added pure-quit command which exits the interpreter and
	nukes its buffer. Added pure-rerun command and make
	pure-toggle-debug-mode automatically restart the interpreter if it
	is currently running.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in (pure-help): Add minibuffer completion for
	the symbol argument of pure-show and pure-clear. This is similar
	to pure-show and pure-clear, but uses 'help_matches' instead of
	'completion_matches' to look up actual index entries.
	(pure-complete-symbol): Add a completion command for Pure mode.

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Rename 'help_matches' to 'help_index' and add
	another 'help_matches' command which enables Emacs Pure mode to
	complete search terms in the global documentation index (similar
	to what 'completion_matches' does for the interpreter command line).

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in (pure-show, pure-clear): Add minibuffer
	completion for the symbol argument of pure-show and pure-clear.

2011-01-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: As suggested by Jason E. Aten, add commands
	to feed Pure code lines and regions into the Pure interpreter,
	similar to what Octave mode offers.
	(pure-scratchpad): New convenience command to create a scratch
	buffer named *pure-scratch* and put it in Pure mode.
	(pure-show, pure-clear): Pure mode commands to show and clear the
	definition of a symbol in the Pure interpreter. These invoke the
	interpreter's 'show' and 'clear' commands and echo the output in
	the Pure eval buffer. pure-show can also be invoked with a prefix
	argument in which case the output of 'show' is inserted into the
	current buffer instead.

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in (pure-help): Make index searches work, to
	properly emulate the new 'help' command of the interpreter.

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Add internal 'help_matches' command which
	enables Emacs Pure mode to look up search terms in the global
	documentation index.

2010-12-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/hellomod: Add a complete example illustrating the use
	of pkg-config in a GNU Makefile to build and install a module.
	This is now much easier since pkg-config provides all the
	necessary information (see below).

2010-12-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in, pure.pc.in: Add pkg-config support. This provides
	the necessary options for compiling Pure modules and linking them
	against the Pure runtime library. Besides the usual options
	provided by pkg-config, the following convenience variables are
	defined and may be queried using pkgconfig's --variable flag:

	- DLL: shared library extension for the host platform
	- PIC: PIC flag if required on the host platform
	- shared: flag used to create shared libraries on the host platform
	- extraflags: same as $shared $PIC

	Together with the libdir variable, this provides you with the
	information needed to build and install most Pure modules without
	much ado.

2010-12-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (scan, lookup): Improve treatment of command line
	options in the search index. These can now be looked up either as
	'help -opt' or as 'help prog -opt'.
	(docmd): Bugfix: qualified id was mistaken for URL in 'help'
	command.

2010-12-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.46 release.

2010-11-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: help command: Improved index search. Also check that
	the online documentation is actually available; if not, print an
	error message with some hints on what went wrong and how to fix it.

	* pure.cc: Cosmetic changes in signon message.

2010-11-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Add --with-mpir to use MPIR (http://www.mpir.org/)
	as a binary-compatible replacement for GMP (experimental). Note
	that using this option might currently cause issues with some Pure
	modules which explicitly link against GMP. If you run into this
	then you should build MPIR with the --enable-gmpcompat configure
	option and just use it as a drop-in replacement for GMP (in this
	case the --with-mpir option isn't needed).

2010-11-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Add --with-static-llvm flag so that the Pure
	runtime can be linked statically against LLVM even if the shared
	LLVM library is installed.

2010-11-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Partial emulation of the new 'help' command
	in Emacs Pure mode. TODO: Currently the index search feature isn't
	implemented yet, so that looking for a search term will always
	send the user to the corresponding link target in purelib.html (if
	it happens to exist).

2010-11-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Add support for the new sphinx-based
	documentation, in particular searching the master index generated
	by sphinx.

2010-10-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.45 release.

2010-10-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (compile): Bugfix: Prevent the compiler from
	going recursive if any of the recompiled closures has a sentry
	attached to it.
	
	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern), runtime.cc: Add support for
	int64* and int64** matrix conversions. Note that these are
	supported for numeric matrices (imatrix) only, you can't pass a
	symbolic matrix of bigint values that way for now.

2010-10-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_check_tag): A small but important change: Allow
	a void* NULL pointer to be passed for any pointer type, like it is
	in C.

2010-10-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/h: Slight modification of the expression data
	structure so that we can now store sentries on all kinds of
	expressions. (This needs 4 bytes more on 32 bit systems. Storage
	size on 64 bit systems is still the same.) This is especially
	convenient with atomic non-pointer data such as file descriptors
	since these can be finalized now.

2010-10-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_has_sentry), lib/primitives.pure (cookedp):
	Reimplement cookedp in terms of a runtime function. This is more
	robust, as the old implementation could be fooled by a sentry
	which happened to look like a 'get_sentry' call.

2010-10-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Make 'run' without arguments rerun the
	interpreter from scratch. (Add -g to also enable debugging.)

	* INSTALL: Update the installation instructions for LLVM and Clang
	2.8. Also add a quick summary for the impatient.

	* interpreter.cc (resolve_external): Improved error handling for
	unresolved externals. We print an error message as before, but
	instead of just aborting the program we now return a dummy
	function which throws a Pure exception when being called.

2010-10-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (pointer_type_name): Use a type name from the
	bitcode file if we have one.

	* runtime.cc (pure_catch): Bugfix: Must unwind the debug_info
	stack in case of a caught exception. Also print a message when in
	debugging mode.

2010-10-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (pointer_type_name): Do a better job of resolving
	unknown types from bitcode files.
	(bctype_name): Let void* in bitcode files be promoted to char*, as
	that's just the way it is. In fact, this really seems much more
	user-friendly than our previous reverse policy of assuming a
	generic void* type for char*.

	* lib/faustui.pure: Provide convenience functions to get and set
	control values.

	* runtime.cc (faust_make_ui): Tag control variable pointers with
	the proper target type (float* or double*, depending on the dsp's
	sample format). This lets applications use the proper pointer
	getters and setters without having to rely on Faust RTTI
	information.

	* lib/strings.pure: The byte string functions *really* return
	char* now. Similarly, we use char** for the byte string vector
	functions. This is necessary to make the results work as described
	in the manual.

	* runtime.cc: Remove the old regex interface from the
	runtime. This has been obsolete since Pure 0.42.

2010-10-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc, interpreter.cc: Implement type checking of pointer
	arguments in the C interface. void* can still be used to pass any
	kind of pointer, but otherwise the pointer types will have to
	match when calling an external function. Also added some more
	supporting operations to the standard library (primitives.pure).

	NOTE: This is highly experimental, and will probably raise lots of
	backward compatibility issues. Cleanly written extern declarations
	should probably be fine, but there's surely quite a bit of code
	out there which needs fixing. We'll hopefully get these sorted out
	for the standard library asap.

	* interpreter.cc: Keep track of pointer type names in the C
	interface.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Expose the tagged pointers interface in the
	standard library (experimental).

2010-10-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern), runtime.cc/h: Overhaul of
	matrix-pointer argument conversions to make the handling of
	pointer parameters more consistent. int*, double* etc. now do call
	by reference so that the matrix can be modified in-place, handling
	the necessary conversions between differently sized int or
	floating point types on the fly. This now works analogously to
	int**, double** etc., except that the matrix is passed as a simple
	pointer instead of a vector of pointers. In addition, int matrices
	can now also be passed for char* and char** parameters,
	interpreting them as byte vectors. So, e.g., puts {72,65,76,0} now
	does what you'd expect it to do (namely interpret the numeric
	values as character codes and thus output the string
	"HAL"). Similarly, int matrices can now be passed as character
	buffers into externals writing into a char* parameter (if you do
	it with care).

	NOTE: The change from pass-by-value to pass-by-reference semantics
	in short*, int*, float* and double* raises backward compatibility
	issues, so some scripts may need fixing. In particular, all matrix
	arguments which are to be passed by value need to be copied now,
	and parameter type checking is more strict (e.g., an int*
	parameter won't accept double matrices any more).

2010-10-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/strings.pure: Add an example showing the use of explicit
	argument vectors in order to deal with functions mutating
	argv-style vectors, such as getopt.

	* lib/system.pure: Rewrite the execv and spawnv functions so that
	they take advantage of the new char** conversions.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Make Faust RTTI work in
	batch-compiled scripts. Also make wrappers for Faust interface
	functions required, so that they can be created dynamically even
	in a batch-compiled script. Cosmetic changes: Split faust_rtti
	into two separate operations, faust_name and faust_dbl. Remove dbl
	flag from the Faust info routines, as it is now readily available
	via faust_dbl.

2010-10-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (faust_mods, faust_rtti): New inspection functions
	for the Faust interface.

	* interpreter.cc (LoadFaustDSP): More cosmetic changes to the
	Faust interface.

	* lexer.ll, interpreter.cc (compile, jit_now): Add a new --eager
	pragma which forces a function to be JITed immediately after
	compilation. This can be used to eliminate the hiccups you get
	when the interpreter JITs a function on the fly when it is first
	invoked (particularly useful for realtime functions).

2010-10-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern, LoadFaustDSP): Add some checking
	on Faust dsp pointers, so that Faust functions from a given module
	will only accept dsp pointers created by this module. Also,
	created dsp objects are now always equipped with a sentry so that
	they take care of freeing themselves when they are
	garbage-collected.

	* runtime.cc, interpreter.cc (LoadFaustDSP): Add some more
	convenience functions to initialize a Faust dsp and get
	information about it.

	* runtime.cc, interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Add support for the
	void** and char** pointer types in the C interface. When passed as
	an argument, these now allow conversions from symbolic vectors of
	pointer and/or string values. In the case of char**, string data
	is converted to the system encoding. For void**, existing pointers
	as well as Pure strings in the Pure vector are passed as is. The
	converted C vectors are always NULL-terminated, which is useful
	for passing argv-style vectors.

2010-10-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/strings.pure: Add conversions between Pure string vectors
	and C byte string vectors.

	* interpreter.cc (inline_code): clang is used instead of llvm-gcc
	as the default C/C++ compiler if Pure itself was compiled with it,
	as suggested by Libor Spacek.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Add support for the short**, int**,
	float** and double** pointer types in the C interface. When passed
	as an argument, these now allow conversions from an int, double or
	complex matrix to a vector of pointers pointing to the rows of the
	matrix, through which the original matrix can also be updated
	in-place. (This has already been available in the Faust interface
	since Pure 0.44, but is now provided for arbitrary external
	functions.)

	* lexer.ll (decl_str): Factor out all the symbol declaration
	printing stuff in the 'show' and 'dump' commands to a separate
	routine. Also, private symbols are now unparsed with the 'private'
	keyword in front of the declaration, so that we can see which
	symbols are private.

	* interpreter.cc (inline_code): Enable C++ support (experimental).
	Language tag is 'c++', environment variable is PURE_CXX.

2010-10-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (LoadBitcode, LoadFaustDSP): Allow bitcode
	modules to be imported into different namespaces. (This doesn't
	actually reload the external operations but only creates new
	aliases of the same externs in a new namespace.) Also strengthened
	the error handling when reloading Faust dsps, so that we catch
	sudden changes in the ABI (faust -single vs. -double) which would
	otherwise break the Pure interface to the dsp.

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, interpreter.cc/hh: Allow 'public' and
	'private' keywords after 'using' and before '%{...%}' to indicate
	the desired scope of symbols imported from bitcode files (default
	is 'public', as before).

2010-10-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll: Syntax support for inline code. The format
	is simply '%{ code %}' which can be placed whereever a toplevel
	item is allowed. Target language selection is done with a tag of
	the form '-*- lang -*-' where 'lang' can currently be any of 'c',
	'fortran' and 'dsp' (the latter is for Faust). The tag, if
	present, must follow the open brace (leading whitespace is
	allowed). By default, 'c' is assumed. Case is insignificant in the
	language tags, so you can also write 'C', 'Fortran', 'DSP'
	etc. For the 'fortran' tag, you may also have to specify the
	appropriate dialect, i.e., 'fortran90' etc.

	The language tag can also be followed by an optional "module
	name", using the format '-*- lang:name -*-'. This is optional for
	C and Fortran, but mandatory for Faust (where it specifies the
	namespace for the DSP routines). So, e.g., a Faust DSP named
	'test' would be specified with a 'dsp:test' tag. Case is
	significant in the module name.

	NOTE: Since the %{...%} construct isn't terminated by a semicolon,
	the grammar had to be massaged to some extent to accommodate for
	the new syntax. Specifically, toplevel items in a 'namespace ns
	with ... end' construct must now always be terminated with a
	semicolon (which seems to be good practice anyway).

	* interpreter.cc (inline_code): Support for inline code which gets
	translated to and then loaded from a bitcode module on the
	fly. Currently supported languages are C, Fortran and Faust. This
	requires that you have the corresponding LLVM-capable compilers
	installed: llvm-gcc or clang for C, llvm-gfortran for Fortran,
	Faust2 (i.e., the Faust compiler from the faust2 branch) for
	Faust. You can adjust the compilation commands with the PURE_CC,
	PURE_FC and PURE_FAUST environment variables, respectively. (E.g.,
	to use clang -O3 instead of the default llvm-gcc, set PURE_CC to
	"clang -O3".) Also, you can check the compilation commands which
	are actually executed by running Pure with the -v0100 option.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Bugfix: Free temporary C
	strings and vectors *after* the result of an extern has been
	boxed, in case the result involves these temporaries. This makes
	stuff like 'extern char *strchr(char *s, int c)' work as expected.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): More permissive type checking
	for C pointer types, so that external functions (including
	functions loaded from bitcode modules) can be redeclared in
	compatible ways (e.g., using char* instead of void* or vice versa)
	provided that the new incarnation uses a different alias/namespace.

2010-10-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (bctype_name): clang compatibility fixes.

	* configure.ac: Link against the shared LLVM library if it is
	available.

	* interpreter.cc (LoadFaustDSP, compiler): Add support for
	reloading Faust dsps on the fly. To make this work, the Pure
	wrappers now call Faust functions indirectly through a global
	variable.

2010-10-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Fix up botched r3494 in which we attempted to bring
	the error handling of floating point lexemes in line with the
	treatment of integer literals. Give integer rules precedence over
	floating point rules so that we don't mistake integer literals
	like 0xe0 for a floating point value.

2010-10-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.44 release.

2010-09-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.h/cc, lib/matrices.pure: Add convenience functions for
	constructing vectors from arithmetic sequences (vectorseq,
	rowvectorseq, colvectorseq). These are optimized for the case of
	int and double ranges.

2010-09-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: LLVM 2.8 compatibility fixes.

2010-09-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/bitcode: Add various C, Fortran and Faust examples for
	the new LLVM bitcode interface.

2010-09-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (LoadBitcode): Generic bitcode interface. This
	allows you to load any LLVM bitcode file and makes the external
	functions defined in the bitcode module callable from Pure. The
	necessary extern declarations are created automagically. To these
	ends, the following special form of the 'using' clause is
	provided: using "bc:name", where 'name' is the basename of the
	bitcode module. (The default '.bc' suffix is supplied
	automatically, and the bitcode module is searched along the usual
	library search path.)

	This is still experimental, but it should work with most kinds of
	C and Fortran functions which can be compiled with llvm-gcc or
	clang, provided that the data types of return values and arguments
	are understood by Pure. Currently no attempt is made to handle the
	name mangling in other languages like C++, so functions will only
	be callable if the function names in the bitcode module follow
	Pure conventions.

2010-09-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (LoadFaustDSP), runtime.cc/hh: Add the necessary
	helper functions and wrappers for accessing the control parameters
	of a Faust DSP.

2010-08-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Link with the LLVM bitreader and linker modules
	required by the Faust interface.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/hh: Experimental direct Faust/LLVM
	interface.

	This allows DSP modules created with Faust's forthcoming LLVM
	backend to be imported directly in Pure, using a special form of
	the 'using' clause: using "dsp:name". Here, 'name' is the basename
	of the bitcode file of the Faust module (the .bc suffix is
	supplied automatically). The Faust interface routines are declared
	as special externs in the 'name' namespace (which is created if
	necessary), so that different Faust modules can be used in the
	same Pure program.

	Currently the provided interface is simply a 1-1 mapping of the
	routines provided by the compiled Faust module. Special support is
	provided for marshalling the float** or double** input/output
	arguments of the 'compute' routine, so that Pure double matrices
	can be passed for the required sample buffers. Each row of a Pure
	matrix corresponds to one block of samples. The number of rows of
	the input/output matrices must match the number of input/output
	channels of the 'process' routine of the Faust program. (It is
	recommended that you build your Faust bitcode modules with the
	-double option of the Faust compiler so that the rows of a Pure
	double matrix can be passed directly to the Faust module. When
	using Faust's default single precision mode, the required
	conversions between double and float sample data will be handled
	automatically, but this will be less efficient.)

	The Faust interface also works in batch compilation, in which case
	the imported Faust modules are embedded in the program generated
	with 'pure -c'.

	Please note that, at this time, the LLVM backend is not yet
	included in the official Faust sources, so you'll need a special
	Faust version which can be obtained from Stephane Letz at Grame.

2010-07-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure (^): Add a rule to work around POSIX
	incompatibilities in some math libraries. Suggested by Roman
	Neuhauser.

2010-07-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, runtime.cc: New 'trace' command for the debugger. This
	works similarly to the the 'break' command but only prints rule
	invocations and reductions without actually interrupting the
	evaluation. Suggested by Yann Orlarey.

2010-07-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll, interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Add a new
	--noconst/--const option which allows you to control the
	precomputing of const values in a batch compilation. Like the
	other code generation options, this option can be set on a
	per-definition basis.

	--const (default): If the value of a const can be precomputed at
	compile time, the compiler will do that and store the computed
	value in the generated executable. This usually yields faster
	startup times at the expense of bigger executables.

	--noconst: The compiler generates code to recompute the constant
	value at runtime instead. This usually means slower startup times
	but smaller executables. Note that this also happens automatically
	for consts containing runtime data (pointers and local functions)
	which need to be recomputed at runtime anyway.

2010-07-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (const_defn, wrap_expr, compiler): Add
	experimental support for handling consts with runtime data in the
	batch compiler, as discussed on the mailing list.

	* matcher.cc (match): The matcher must be able to match runtime
	objects wrapped in compile time expressions. This fixes spurious
	failures when matching pointers in const definitions.

	* interpreter.cc (const_defn, compiler): Keep track of free
	symbols which are overridden by a const aggregate. In batch
	compilation we need to generate variable table entries for these,
	to avoid segfaults in batch-compiled programs if the shadowed
	symbol was used already in earlier definitions.

2010-07-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Add experimental support for having -w warn
	about implicit declarations of symbols in the default namespace,
	as discussed on the mailing list. Also fixed up the library
	scripts accordingly.

2010-07-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (exec): Allow printed expression results to be
	piped through the program named with PURE_LESS (similar to what
	'show' does with PURE_MORE), as suggested by asitdepends.

	* lexer.ll: Fix up treatment of floating point constants in the
	lexer so that typos are treated in a manner consistent with
	integer constants. Reported by asitdepends.

	* lib/prelude.pure, lib/strings.pure, lib/matrices.pure: Make
	the 'tuple', 'string' and 'matrix' conversions act as the identity
	if the argument is already of the corresponding type. Suggested by
	Eddie Rucker and John Cowan.

2010-06-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure_main.c: Make sure that the locale is properly initialized
	for standalone batch-compiled Pure programs. Fixes issue #38
	reported by Masahiro Miura.

2010-06-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure, symtable.cc: Overhaul precedence table so that
	$$ and $ are on different precedence levels now, as suggested by
	Peter Summerland.

	* lib/system.pure: Add additional checks to prevent segfaults due
	to fclose and similar operations being run twice on the same file
	pointer, as reported by Eddie Rucker.

2010-06-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Overhaul of record index storage in order to fix
	apparent alignment problems on 32 bit FreeBSD reported by Roman
	Neuhauser (issue #35).

2010-05-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Overhaul of the configury to make
	autoreconf work. To these ends, config/aclocal.m4 was moved to the
	toplevel source directory and renamed to acinclude.m4. Also, the
	generated configure script was removed from svn, as suggested by
	Roman Neuhauser.

	NOTE: This means that if you use the svn version, beginning with
	r3442 autoreconf needs to be run to generate the configure script
	if the configury (configure.ac, acinclude.m4) changes. If you
	already have a Makefile, 'make' takes care of this automatically,
	otherwise you'll have to run 'autoreconf' manually. The
	installation instructions have been updated accordingly.

	* Makefile.in: pure-mode.el should be generated in the build, not
	the source directory, so that with a separate build directory the
	source directory stays clean of generated files (except those in
	DISTFILES). Patch contributed by Roman Neuhauser (issue #37).

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Complete overhaul of 'make check'
	contributed by Roman Neuhauser (issue #36). This is implemented by
	the new scripts run-tests and run-test. Individual tests can now
	be run as './run-tests test/test020.pure test/test047.pure'. Also,
	you can just rerun the tests that failed on the last invocation
	with './run-tests -f' or 'make recheck'.

2010-05-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* printer.cc: Cosmetic changes in the expression printer. It's
	sufficient (and looks much nicer) if we just parenthesize operands
	for non-associative operators. So, for instance '(x=>y)=>z'
	unparses as is now, rather than '(=>) (x=>y) z'.

	* Makefile.in: Various changes and improvements to the dist,
	distcheck and install targets contributed by Roman Neuhauser. This
	resolves issues #31-34.

2010-04-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_tzset), configury: Various FreeBSD-related
	fixes contributed by Roman Neuhauser. Fixes issues #28-30.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Added key, val functions on hash pairs, as
	suggested by asitdepends. Also add some notes about hash pairs to
	the documentation of the prelude.

2010-04-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (codegen, const_defn et al): Fixed a bug in the
	batch compiler which caused unquoted global function symbols to
	remain unevaluated in initialization code for const definitions.
	Also improved error reporting on other runtime data in const
	definitions.

2010-04-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/matrices.pure: Refactoring and cosmetic changes. Also, the
	rowvector and colvector operations can now be used to convert
	lists, tuples and matrices to row and column vectors, and the
	vector function is provided as a synonym for rowvector.

	* configure.ac: Bail out with an error message if libgmp or gmp.h
	is missing (fixes issue #27 reported by ono@java.pl).

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in, strptime.c, util.cc/hh: Windows
	compatibility fixes, reported by Jiri Spitz.

2010-04-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, interpreter.cc (compiler): Add --required pragma to
	tell the batch compiler about functions which should never be
	stripped from the executable.

2010-04-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc, lib/system.pure: Added mktime, as suggested by Peter
	Summerland. Also added a wrapper for tzset which initializes
	the (Pure) variables timezone, daylight and tzname accordingly.

	* runtime.cc, lib/system.pure: Add strptime, tzname, timezone,
	daylight. Also added the SIZEOF_TM constant which gives the actual
	size of the tm struct. Improved documentation of the time
	functions.

	* util.cc: Add an emulation of strptime for systems which don't
	have it (Windows). Unfortunately, this only supports the C locale
	right now.

2010-03-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* config/config.guess, config/config.sub: Update to latest version
	from autoconf 2.65. This hopefully fixes issues with the target
	triple on OSX 10.6, which causes wrong code to be generated by llc
	in batch compilation. Reported by Michael Ashton.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Add -L option to the link command so
	that the linker finds the installed libpure if it's not on the
	usual linker path. Reported by Michael Ashton.

2010-03-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Post-release version bump.

2010-03-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.43 release.

2010-03-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/fortran.pure/f90: Add an example which shows how to
	call (GNU) Fortran code from Pure.

	* configure.ac, examples/Makefile.in: Add a Makefile to compile
	the C examples.

2010-03-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/dict.pure, lib/set.pure, lib/avltrees.pure: More bugfixes
	and optimizations. For convenience, ordered dicts/sets/bags only
	need to have '<' defined on the members any more. Different
	dictionary or set/bag/types can be mixed in infix operations (+,
	-, * as well as the comparison operators), the necessary
	conversions to the most general operand type are now handled
	automatically.

2010-03-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/dict.pure, lib/set.pure, lib/avltrees.pure: Overhaul of the
	AVL trees data structure, in order to better support existing (and
	some new) dictionary and set operations, as discussed on the
	mailing list. Fixed some bugs in comparisons of bags and
	multidicts. Added support for set operations (+, -, *) and subset
	comparisons to the dictionary types. Also added direct conversions
	between the various dictionary and set types.

2010-03-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/set.pure: Add hashed sets and bags. These are like the
	ordered sets and bags but members don't have to be ordered.

2010-03-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/dict.pure: Add ordered and hashed multidicts. These are like
	the plain ordered and hashed dicts but can associate a key with
	multiple values.

2010-03-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, interpreter.cc/hh, symtable.cc: Complete overhaul of
	the symbol resolution algorithm. As suggested by Thomas_H on the
	mailing list, new unqualified symbols, as well as unqualified
	symbols being defined in a rule or let/const definition are now
	always promoted to the current namespace, as one might reasonably
	expect. This replaces the previous method of placing new
	unqualified symbols into the default namespace, which was pretty
	much broken by design. It also makes it possible to introduce new
	symbols in arbitrary namespaces on the fly (without requiring
	explicit or implicit declarations), and thereby makes the
	treatment of global and user-defined namespaces much more
	consistent.

2010-03-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, interpreter.cc/hh, symtable.cc/hh, pure.cc:
	Added a restricted form of the 'using namespace' construct. You
	can now write something like:

		using namespace foo ( foo bar );

	This indicates that instead of the entire namespace only the
	symbols (identifiers or operator symbols) given in parentheses
	behind the namespace name are to be visible in unqualified
	form. The imported symbols must already be declared.

2010-03-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (add_rule, add_macro_rule): Fix up changes from
	2010-02-14 so that we don't clobber the EXPR::QUAL flag just to
	make the pretty printer happy. Instead, use a second EXPR::GLOBAL
	flag to denote head symbols in global rules. This fixes a bug
	where the EXPR::QUAL flag on the head symbol would be missing in
	successor rules, causing code to be miscompiled in certain rare
	circumstances.

2010-03-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (checkfuns, checkvars): For consistency, apply
	the strict symbol checking rules of the new scoped namespace
	declaration also to the the old, unscoped construct (cf. ChangeLog
	entry from 2010-02-26 below).

2010-02-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/hh: Overhaul of the JIT
	infrastructure. This adds some bits for LLVM 2.7 compatibility,
	and fixes segfaults due to dangling function pointers if a
	function or its parent environment gets overwritten or cleared
	while closure objects referencing that code are still in use
	(cf. test052.pure).

2010-02-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, interpreter.cc/hh: Add support for an
	alternative, scoped form of the namespace declaration which offers
	more structure and additional safety features at the expense of
	some convenience.

	Scoped namespaces take the form

		namespace name with items end;

	where 'name' is the namespace id and 'items' is a ';'-delimited
	list of declarations and definitions in the same format as the
	toplevel. The scope of the namespace extends from the 'namespace
	... with' clause up to the matching 'end'. The declarations and
	definitions inside the scope are used to populate the namespace as
	detailed below. Declaration of symbols works in the same way as
	with the unscoped 'namespace' declaration. Scoped namespaces
	differ from ordinary 'namespace' declarations in the following
	aspects:

	- They can be nested to an arbitrary depth. At each matching 'end'
	the previous namespace is restored.
	
	- 'using namespace' declarations are local to the namespace
	scope. At each matching 'end' the previous search namespaces are
	restored.

	- Strict checking of unqualified symbols. *All* unqualified
	variable symbols in 'let' and 'const' definitions, as well as
	*all* unqualified head symbols of function and macro rules in the
	namespace scope *must* have been declared previously in the same
	namespace (either by an explicit symbol declaration or implictly
	by using its qualified form), otherwise the compiler complains
	about an undeclared symbol.

	The latter fixes an annoying issue with the ordinary 'namespace'
	construct, namely that an unqualified symbol may accidentally be
	mistyped in a definition, causing either a global definition in
	the default namespace to be clobbered, or a new symbol to be
	declared implicitly in the default namespace. With the scoped
	namespace declaration this can never happen, you will always get a
	sensible error message in such cases.

2010-02-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* printer.cc: Cosmetic changes in print representation of local
	symbols which happen to be created outside the default
	namespace. The namespace prefix isn't really relevant in this
	context and may actually be confusing, so it's not printed any
	more.

	* lib/dict.pure: Rename Hdict constructor to HDict.

	* lexer.ll: Warn about dubious punctuation immediately following
	an identifier in a symbol declaration. Reported by Kay-Uwe
	Kirstein.

2010-02-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/dict.pure, lib/set.pure: Overhaul of the dictionary and set
	container data structures. The underlying AVL tree implementation
	has been factored out into a separate avltrees.pure module, which
	now provides generic support for all tree types (ordered/hashed,
	dictionary/set-like, with/without multiple keys). This opens the
	possibility to add support for hashed sets and multi-dicts in the
	future. The new implementation passes all tests and performance
	seems to be in the same ballpark as the old implementation.

2010-02-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Fix glitches in integer syntax (issue #23), reported
	by Geert Janssen.

2010-02-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Handle "tail bindings" of the form
	'x when ...; x = y end' where x is a local variable. In such a
	case we can always eliminate x by transforming the expression to
	'y when ... end'. If the 'when' clause consists of a single
	binding, we can eliminate it altogether.

2010-02-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_try_call, pure_invoke, pure_catch): Plug some
	memory leaks. Temporary expressions created while executing the
	Pure function are now collected immediately, rather than leaving
	this up to the toplevel.
	(pure_sort): Handle the case that a comparison doesn't return a
	machine int by throwing a 'failed_cond' exception. Also add
	exception handling code to perform proper cleanup after a Pure
	exception was thrown during the qsort() invocation.

2010-02-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (new_ref_expr): Fix missing update of freelist
	counter, which caused wrong memory usage statistics.

2010-02-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* expr.cc (~EXPR): Avoid freeing the matching automaton of a
	lambda expression in debugging mode, as the rule stored in the
	automaton may still be inspected by the debugger. This fixes issue
	#22 reported by Max Wolf.

2010-02-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (add_rule, add_macro_rule): Get rid of extra
	qualifier flag in the head symbol of a rewriting rule. Reported by
	Max Wolf.

2010-02-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc: Rename '-t' option to '-T' for compatibility with other
	utilities processing tags files.

2010-02-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Add 'bt' command to print the backtrace (see
	below), instead of printing it automatically when in debugging
	mode. Also, output is piped through PURE_MORE if set.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Experimental support for printing
	backtraces in case of an unhandled exception. This needs debugging
	mode (-g) to work.

	* interpreter.cc (macval): Check non-linearities in macro rules.
	Reported by Geert Janssen.
	(logical_tailcall): Add missing debugging hooks for tail calls of
	logical ops, fixing a failed assertion in the debugger reported by
	Max Wolf. Also, make logical_tailcall invoke toplevel_codegen
	recursively on the second operand, so that TCO is done properly on
	logical op chains involving more than a single operation.

2010-02-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (searchdir, run): Implement a new 'sys:' tag to
	bypass the initial search of the current script directory, as
	suggested by Max Wolf. This gives the same kind of functionality
	as the C preprocessor's '#include <...>' construct. In addition,
	the '.pure' suffix is now added to script filenames in double
	quotes if it's not already present. So you can now write something
	like 'using "sys:math";' to load a standard library script even if
	another script of the same name already exists in the directory of
	the script containing the 'using' clause.

	* interpreter.cc/hh: LLVM 2.7 compatibility fixes, contributed by
	Jeffrey Yasskin.

2010-02-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/system.pure (fgets, fget, sprintf): Replace repeated
	concatenation with strcat to prevent quadratic complexity.
	Contributed by Jiri Spitz.

2010-02-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, util.cc: Add support for int/bigint literals and
	character escapes in base 2 (0b or 0B prefix), as suggested by
	Geert Janssen.

2010-02-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Add a 'Make Tags' (pure-make-tags
	a.k.a. C-c M-t) command to run 'pure --etags' on the script in the
	current buffer.

	* interpreter.cc, parser.yy, pure.cc: Add ctags and etags
	support (experimental).

	The new --ctags and --etags options let you create a ctags or
	etags format tags file which can be used with vi, emacs and other
	text editors to quickly locate global symbol declarations and
	definitions in a collection of Pure scripts. The source
	scripts (or just the prelude, if no scripts are given on the
	command line) are parsed as usual, but without executing them. The
	resulting tags table is then written to the file given by the -t
	option ('tags' for --ctags, 'TAGS' for --etags by default).

2010-01-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Simplify symbol selection logic in
	clear/dump/show. Also, at temporary level 0 operator symbols are
	now listed even if they don't have any rules associated with them.

2010-01-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.42 release.

2010-01-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Add a '-m' option to the 'stats' command to
	explicitly enable printing of memory usage along with the cpu time.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc: Overhaul of evaluation
	statistics. We now also print the memory requirements of an
	evaluation (in terms of the maximum number of expression cells
	being used during an evaluation).

2010-01-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, pure.cc: New 'mem' command.

	* interpreter.cc (mem_usage): New method to report current usage
	of expression memory.

	* lib/system.pure: Add lazy variations regexgs, regexggs,
	regsplits of regexg, regexgg, regsplit.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/system.pure: Complete overhaul of low-level
	regex interface. This makes the implementation of the high-level
	routines (regex and friends) in system.pure much simpler. Also,
	the highlevel routines are now much faster and use much less
	temporary memory.

2010-01-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.1: Update manpage, which still mentioned the -s option
	rather than -u.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/strings.pure: Implement join and split in the
	runtime. Especially the Pure version of split was rather slow
	because of the excessive copying of substrings which resulted in
	quadratic complexity.

2010-01-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/system.pure: Dito for regexg, regexgg, regsub and
	regsplit. Also plugged some small memory leaks in the regex
	operations (regmatches result).

	* lib/strings.pure: Make split tail-recursive, so that it runs
	faster and doesn't hog memory. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

2010-01-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.41 release.

	* runtime.cc (pure_new_vect2): Missing return statement after call
	to pure_new_vect. This caused references to members of symbolic
	vectors and other contiguous symbolic matrices to be counted
	twice, resulting in memory leaks. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

2010-01-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (matrix fold/scan operations): Fix segfaults due to
	untimely freeing of arguments, affecting operations like foldl min
	where the result of the application may be a subterm of the
	arguments. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2010-01-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/hh, lib/records.pure: Experimental record
	implementation in terms of symbolic key=>value vectors.
	Appropriate support is provided in the runtime so that the basic
	lookup and update operations are reasonably efficient. The prelude
	now includes records.pure so that these operations are always
	available.

	* lib/primitives.pure (atomp, closurep): New convenience functions
	to check for atoms (named function or variable) and
	closures (named function or lambda).

2010-01-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (declare): Bugfix: Check that left and right
	bracket in an outfix declaration are distinct.

	* parser.yy: Add a syntax for declaring infix/prefix/postfix
	operators at the same precedence level as a given existing
	operator. E.g., to declare a new infixl operator ++, you can
	now write:

	infixl (+) ++;

	This will give the new ++ operator the same precedence as the +
	operator. (The actual fixity of the existing operator may be
	different from the type of fixity in the declaration, but the
	operator must have a proper precedence level, i.e., it must not be
	an outfix or nonfix operator.)

	* runtime.cc (reduce): Fix up the reduce_with built-in so that
	local redefinitions of the list and tuple constructors work as
	expected.

2010-01-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh: Due to popular demand, the semantics of the
	short-circuit operators (&& and ||) were reworked so that they are
	both extensible and tail-recursive now. The builtins are now
	implemented as if defined by the following equations, where the
	second operand y is only evaluated if necessary:

	x::int && y = if x then x else y;
	x::int || y = if x then y else x;

	If the builtin definitions fail then the second operand is
	evaluated and the resulting symbolic term is handled as usual,
	i.e., it is reduced using the equations specified by the
	programmer, and if the term is in normal form then it is returned
	as is. Thus && and || can now be used in symbolic evaluations just
	like the other builtins.

	Note that this implies that the values returned by && and ||
	aren't normalized to 0/1 any more (this isn't possible with tail
	call semantics). If you need this then you'll have to make sure
	that either the operands are normalized or you'll have to
	normalize the result yourself.

	* examples/recursive.pure: Add support for batch compilation.

	* interpreter.cc (builtin_codegen): Fix to make logical operators
	work correctly (i.e., throw an exception) when applied to double
	arguments.

2010-01-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (interpreter), pure.cc (main): Make stripping of
	unused functions the default in batch compilation. The -u option
	can now be used to get a full, unstripped executable. The -s
	(stripped) option is still supported for backward compatibility,
	but doesn't have any effect (except that it overrides a previous
	-u option).

2010-01-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/system.pure: Add several missing standard I/O functions from
	the C library: fileno, fdopen, freopen, tmpfile, setvbuf, setbuf.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): Add BUFSIZE and _IO?BF constants.

2010-01-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (doeval, dodefn): Fixed uncaught exceptions while
	evaluating list and tuple constants. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2010-01-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure.plist: Pure syntax highlighting for BBEdit and
	TextWrangler contributed by Hoigaard/autotelicum.

2010-01-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in: Bump the library version number. While the runtime
	ABI itself hasn't changed, the calling sequence for parameterless
	Pure functions is slightly different now, so batch-compiled
	programs compiled for previous Pure versions will not work any
	more.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/h: Add support for indirect tail
	calls. Uses the extended trampoline technique to prevent function
	calls via the runtime from overflowing the stack. This makes
	indirect calls (including global function calls) a little bit
	slower, but in exchange we get reliable tail call optimization for
	*all* function calls which seems to be worth a tiny sacrifice in
	speed.

2010-01-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/math.pure: Update the Mersenne Twister to the
	2002 version which fixes some issues with certain kinds of seed
	values. Also added some convenience functions to compute 31 bit
	unsigned ints and 53 bit double values.

2009-12-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/h, printer.cc: Optimize exception
	machinery. Also use _setjmp/_longjmp if we have it.

2009-12-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.40 release.

2009-12-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Fix incompatibilities with latest flex versions (cvs,
	OSX 10.6) where yyleng and yy_n_chars were changed to size_t.
	Fixes issue #21 reported by autotelicum.

2009-12-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Version bump.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Rename __C::reduce to reduce_with and make
	it available in the default namespace. This is the primitive on
	which the reduce macro is built, which has turned out to be useful
	in its own right, so that we make it officially available now.

2009-12-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, expr.cc/hh: Add support for non-linearities
	on the left-hand side of rules. Multiple occurrences of a variable
	on the lhs (or in the argument patterns of a lambda) are now
	checked automatically for syntactic equality using 'same', so that
	rewriting rules like a*b+a*c = a*(b+c) work as expected.

2009-12-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, expr.cc/hh, printer.cc: Add support for
	proper multiple argument lambdas. Thus a multiarg lambda like
	'\x y z -> x*y+z' is now roughly equivalent to a local function
	'f with f x y z = x*y+z end' rather than being reduced to nested
	single-argument lambdas.

	As discussed on the mailing list, this has the advantage that
	'nargs' now reports the proper argument count. It is also more
	efficient because a multiarg lambda is now executed as a single
	function call. OTOH, it means that multiarg lambdas are now
	subject to the same linearity constraints as named functions, thus
	'\x x->x*x' is now an error rather than being equivalent to
	'\y x->x*x'.

2009-12-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Make sure that we always include the
	__show__ function if it's defined. This prevents the __show__
	function from being stripped from the output code when
	batch-compiling with -s.

2009-12-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/sortalgos.pure: Added sorting algorithms example.

	* examples/sudoku.pure: Added sudoku example by Peter
	Bernschneider.

2009-12-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.39 release.

	* examples/huffman.pure, examples/combinators.pure: Add Huffman
	encoding and lambda/combinator calculus examples.

	* interpreter.cc (find_stacked): Fix up calls to globals when
	there happens to be a local function of the same name in the
	current environment.

2009-12-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* util.cc (default_encoding): Attempt to make Unicode encodings
	work on Windows. To these ends, we now use GetOEMCP instead of
	GetACP, and map the 65000 and 65001 codepages to the proper UTF
	encodings.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added missing operations to subtract an int
	or bigint from a pointer.

2009-12-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (varp): Fix up variable predicate so that it returns
	false for non-identifier symbols.

2009-12-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, interpreter.cc: Add some pragmas (compiler directives)
	to control the various code generation options on a per-rule basis.

	These take the form '#! --xxx' where --xxx is the option name as
	you would type it on the command line (e.g., '#! --nochecks').
	Pragmas must start in column 1 and may optionally be followed by a
	line-oriented comment ('// ...').

2009-12-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (csubst, bsubst): Experimental support for
	constant folding in the frontend. This means that constant
	expressions involving int and double values and the usual
	arithmetic and logical operations on these are now precomputed at
	compile time. (Previously, the compiler left this to the LLVM
	backend.)

	This option is enabled by default, and can be controlled with the
	PURE_NOFOLD environment variable and the --nofold/--fold command
	line switches. (Please note that disabling this option only
	inhibits constant folding in the frontend, the LLVM backend will
	still do constant folding and dead code elimination as usual.)

	* configure.ac: Post-release version bump.

2009-12-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.38 release.

2009-11-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc, pure.cc: Bugfixes in signal
	processing code.

	* pure.cc, runtime.cc: Add PURE_NOTC environment variable and --tc
	option, so that --notc can be made the default.

2009-11-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/hh, pure.cc: Add extra checks, so
	that stack overflows and pending signals are now caught reliably
	in the function prolog.

	This is enabled by default, but as there is a small runtime
	performance penalty (typically less than 5% in cpu time),
	generation of the extra checks can be controlled with the
	PURE_NOCHECKS environment variable as well as the new --nochecks
	and --checks command line options of the interpreter.

	* run-tests: Add PURE_FLAGS environment variable to pass extra
	options to the Pure interpreter when running 'make check'.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc, pure.cc: Add --notc option to
	disable tail call optimization at runtime.

2009-11-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc: Defer JIT compilation of global
	functions until they're called for the first time. See LAZY_JIT in
	interpreter.hh. This seems to speed up compilation of small
	programs a little bit, at the expense of some (negligible) runtime
	overhead.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/hh: Changes to prevent
	batch-compiled aggregate consts to be reevaluated at
	initialization time.

2009-11-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (const_defn): Generate initialization code for
	constant aggregates when batch-compiling.

2009-11-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (const_defn, clearsym): Only constant scalars are
	inlined, constant aggregates are now cached in a read-only global
	variable instead. As discussed on the mailing list, this makes the
	efficient handling of big constant values much easier for the
	programmer.

	* expr.cc/hh, printer.cc: Changes to accommodate caching of
	constant aggregates (see above).

2009-11-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (bind, lcsubst): Pointer values and wrapped
	closures must not occur on the lhs of equations.

	Note that since there are no literal constants of these types, the
	only way that these could sneak in is through a nonfix const
	symbol. It might be worthwhile to handle at least NULL pointers
	here, but as it's a rare corner case and not currently supported
	by the TA generation algorithm, we forbid that, too.

2009-11-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Post-release version bump.

	* runtime.h: Move the definitions of the GSL-compatible matrix
	structs into a separate gsl_structs.h header.

2009-11-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.37 release.

	* lib/matrices.pure: Add support for sorting numeric matrices.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sort): Add support for sorting symbolic
	matrices.

2009-11-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/h, lib/primitives.pure: Add new 'sort' function
	which interfaces to the C qsort() function.

	* w3centities.c: Updated to latest W3C entity
	definitions (2009-11-19).

2009-11-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy: Massage grammar so that we correctly parse
	identifiers in a symbol declaration even if they have been
	declared as operators in the global namespace.

2009-11-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (parse_simple): Bugfix in operator precedence
	parser (failed assertion when parsing an unparenthesized postfix
	operator application inside a function application; this is a
	syntax error now). Reported by Sergei Winitzki.

2009-11-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Finish license changes, add proper copyright notices to all
	source files, update documentation. This means:

	- The Pure runtime and standard library are now under the LGPLv3+.

	- pure.cc remains under the GPLv3+ (readline dependency). However,
	an alternate, readline-free version (pure_norl.cc) is now available
	under a BSD-style license.

	- The examples are now under a BSD-style license as well.

2009-11-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* util.cc (cksum): Replace GPL-licensed with BSD-licensed code.

2009-11-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Remove GSL-related configury, it isn't needed any
	more.

	* pure.cc, runtime.cc/h, interpreter.cc, printer.cc: Remove all
	dependencies on the GSL library, and add an emulation of the basic
	GSL matrix construction functions to the runtime. We do this so
	that the runtime and the standard library can be licensed under
	the LGPL in the future. Moreover, numeric Pure matrices now work
	even if GSL is not installed.

2009-10-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc, runtime.cc/h, interpreter.cc, lexer.ll,
	lib/system.pure: Move readline/editline support entirely into
	pure.cc, and remove readline support from the runtime and the
	library. We do this so that the runtime and the standard library
	can be licensed under the LGPL in the future. Also, it's now
	possible to build the interpreter without having readline or
	editline installed.

	* configure.ac, aclocal.m4: Add support for BSD editline/libedit
	(http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/) as a GNU readline replacement.
	Also, make it possible to optionally disable readline and/or
	editline support at configure time (--without-readline,
	--without-editline).

2009-10-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.36 release.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Back out r2162 from 2009-08-31, so
	that we do keep track of compile time environment reference counts
	again, and delete the environments as soon as they are no longer
	needed. This fixes leaks of JIT function stubs if the environment
	contained local functions which could eventually cause the JIT to
	abort the interpreter when running out of function stubs.

	NOTE: This change was originally done to work around some (bogus)
	failed assertions on some systems if LLVM was compiled with
	--enable-expensive-checks (reported by Roman Neuhauser). So you
	should make sure to use --disable-expensive-checks (as recommended
	in the Pure installation instructions) when compiling LLVM.

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, interpreter.cc: Add support for pure_val
	operation.

	* runtime.cc (eval, pure_eval): Fail if we got an error message,
	even if there is a result.
	(pure_val): New function which just parses a simple expression and
	returns it as is, as suggested by Vili Aapro.
	(val): Call pure_val for string arguments.

2009-10-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_symbolx, pure_funcallx, pure_appx)
	(pure_appxl, pure_appxv): New operations to invoke Pure functions
	and handle exceptions.

2009-09-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (error): Work around a segfault while printing an
	error message, when the standard C++ I/O streams haven't been
	properly initialized yet. In particular, this may happen when the
	interpreter runs embedded in a C application.

2009-09-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_force): Bugfix: Must create a new matrix view
	when memoizing a matrix.

2009-09-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.35 release.

2009-09-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_symbol): Bugfix: On entry to this function,
	there might still be some Pure functions awaiting compilation, do
	this if necessary. Otherwise literal symbols would be returned for
	functions which were already defined, but haven't been compiled	yet.

2009-09-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (init): Add the strcmp() function to the extern
	table, to work around a dynamic linker issue on FC12 Rawhide which
	causes the function to be resolved incorrectly by dlsym().

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* INSTALL: Add ppc instructions.

	* test/test042.pure, test/ppc32-linux32.blob: Add ppc32 test.

	* runtime.cc (double_hash, Blob): PowerPC compatibility fixes.

2009-09-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, interpreter.hh: Add configure option for disabling
	fastcc/TCO which, as of LLVM 2.6, is still broken on some
	systems (ppc).

2009-09-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Add support for online help (C-c C-h in
	Pure and Pure-Eval mode, also available in the Pure menu). To get
	the most out of this, make sure that you have emacs-w3m
	installed (http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/, not to be confused with
	emacs-w3!).

2009-09-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.34 release.

	* lexer.ll: Remove the 'nullary' keyword which has been deprecated
	since Pure 0.26. If you haven't updated your Pure sources yet,
	you'll have to do so now.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Overhaul organization of the batch
	compiler and add support for LLVM bitcode output. Also, the new
	batch compiler only needs the basic LLVM toolchain (llc+opt) and
	gcc to produce native output code, so we don't rely on llvmc and
	the llvm-gcc behemoth any more, which has kept many people from
	taking advantage of the batch compiler.

	The batch compiler now recognizes and generates output code for
	the following file types:

	- .ll (or stdout), .bc: LLVM assembler and bitcode.

	- .s, .o: Native assembler and object code.

	In all other cases, output code is written to a temporary .bc file
	which is then passed to llc+opt+gcc to create an object file,
	which, as before, is finally linked with a minimal 'main' to
	create an executable. The main differences here are that llc+opt
	are invoked directly (rather than through llvmc), that intermediate
	files are in bitcode or native assembly format (which also speeds
	up compilation), and that gcc is used instead of llvm-gcc.

	Also note that the PURE_COPTS environment variable (which was
	formely used to pass options to llvmc) is much less useful now and
	has thus been removed. 'opt' is now always invoked with all
	standard optimization options, and the interpreter accepts the
	-fPIC option to make llc generate position-independent code where
	this is needed. If you really want to pass additional options to
	the toolchain, you can do so by compiling to .ll or .bc format and
	then invoking opt, llc and gcc manually.

2009-09-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in: Also bump the version of the runtime library
	because of the API change in pure_interp_compile(). Note that this
	requires a reconfigure and a recompile of all addon modules.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* runtime.cc (pure_interp_compile): Rework the eager compilation
	operation so that it becomes more useful in realtime applications.
	pure_interp_compile takes one extra argument now, a function
	symbol fno to denote a global function to be JITed, along with all
	its callees (transitively). Use fno=0 to get the old behaviour of
	just JITing the entire program (which is very slow).

2009-09-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (init): LLVM 2.6 compatibility fixes.

2009-08-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Remove reference counts and
	automatic memory management on compile time environments (Env*) of
	global expressions and variable definitions. This causes many
	issues with thunks and when LLVM is compiled with
	--enable-expensive-checks (reported by Roman Neuhauser), and
	doesn't really seem to be worth the effort, so instead we now just
	leak some memory there.

	* configure.ac: Add checks for flex and bison. Warn when these
	programs are missing, and also warn about some ancient flex
	versions. This also makes it possible to specify alternative
	programs using the FLEX and BISON variables at configure or build
	time. Suggested by Roman Neuhauser.

2009-08-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: GNU Emacs compatibility fixes. Also, the
	PURE_INCLUDE path, if defined, is now used to locate source
	scripts in error messages.

	* configure.ac, interpreter.cc, lexer.cc: LLVM 2.3 compatibility
	fixes.

2009-08-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Fixes to make source compile when GSL is not
	installed. Reported by Roman Neuhauser, cf.
	http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/issues/detail?id=15.

2009-08-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.33 release.

	* configure.ac: Bumped version number.

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Cosmetic changes in Pure mode. In
	particular, provide sensible defaults for the location of the Pure
	interpreter executable and the library directory if the PURELIB
	environment variable is set.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Fix failed assertions in llvm::Value
	destructors when compiling with -s option.

	* Makefile.in: FreeBSD compatibility fixes in linkage options.

2009-08-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.32 release.

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: XEmacs compatibility fixes.

2009-08-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Complete overhaul of Emacs Pure mode. In
	particular, all the broken indentation stuff was removed. The new
	version probably requires a fairly recent Emacs version (GNU Emacs
	22.3.1 has been tested).

2009-08-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in, run-tests: Cosmetic changes in the test system
	(make check). The tests are run in a separate shell script now,
	and return a proper exit code (1 if any of the tests failed). Also
	fixed up test042.pure so that it works when run in a separate
	build directory.

	* pure.cc (main): Add LLVM version to --version option.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Rewrote LLVM assembler code emitter
	to get around performance bugs with latest LLVM versions.

2009-08-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.31 release.

	* interpreter.cc, etc.: More fixes for LLVM 2.7 (svn)
	compatibility.

2009-08-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy: Put if-then-else at the same level as the other
	special expressions, as suggested by Eddie Rucker. This makes it
	possible to use lambda and 'case' inside conditionals without
	having to parenthesize them.

	Note that if-then-else still binds stronger than 'when' and
	'with', so 'if x then y else z when x = ... end' is parsed as
	'(if x then y else z) when x = ... end', as before. OTOH, since
	lambda binds weakest among the special expressions,
	'if x then f else \x->f (f x) with f x = x+1 end' (which was
	previously a syntax error) is now parsed as
	'if x then f else (\x->f (f x) with f x = x+1 end)', so beware!

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Strip global variables for unused
	function pointers from the output code, to further reduce code
	size.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, configure.ac: Lots of changes for LLVM 2.6
	compatibility. Pure builds and runs with the LLVM 2.6 branch in
	svn now.

2009-08-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.30 release.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* runtime.cc (pure_funcall): Add a convenience function for
	calling Pure functions in batch-compiled code.

	* pure.cc (main): Add -s option to strip unused functions from
	compiled executables (batch compiler).

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Add a pass to eliminate unused
	functions.

2009-08-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.29 release.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* Makefile.in: Beef up stack size to the recommended 8 MB for
	Windows builds.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Add -Wl,--stack option to the linkage
	command on Windows to increase the stack size of batch-compiled
	programs.  Unfortunately, it seems that the LLVM 2.5 linker
	doesn't honor this flag, so for the time being you may have to set
	the stack size of the .exe file yourself using the MS editbin
	program.

2009-08-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Must clear interp.result in addition to interp.lastres
	if the former is the same as the latter, in order to properly
	clear the 'ans' value.

	* runtime.cc: Allow sentries on symbols and function objects.

2009-08-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.28 release.

	* examples/fork.pure: Add an example showing how to use fork() to
	implement a form of concurrent future which asynchronously
	evaluates a stream in a child process.

	* lib/posix.pure: Added a supplementary module with some
	additional useful system functions which might not be available on
	all systems.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Add an extern declaration for exit(), so
	that programs may call it without having to import the system
	module.

	* runtime.cc: Add various useful system constants, including the
	stuff needed for stat, fseek, wait and open/fcntl. Also added
	wrappers for the Windows spawnv family (on Un*x these are emulated
	using fork/execv), and made the execv/spawnv functions available
	in the system module.

	* lib/system.pure: Add stat, fseek et al to the interface.

	* runtime.cc: Add wrappers for stat() and friends.

2009-08-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* test/test042.pure: Add a test for writing and reading serialized
	blobs.

2009-08-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Deal with data representation and endianness issues
	in the serialization format, so that the serialized representation
	should hopefully be cross-platform now. (This still needs
	testing.)

	* lib/primitives.pure: Add extern declarations for the
	serialization functions.

	* runtime.cc: Add support for shared subexpressions, crc check and
	auto-freeing of serialized blobs to the serialization functions.

	* test/test041.pure: Test for expression serialization.

	* runtime.cc: Add expression serialization support (experimental).

2009-08-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (run), pure.cc (main): Make namespace settings
	stick when running a script interactively or sourcing the
	interactive initialization files. Suggested by Max Wolf.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* lib/strings.pure: Moved eval and friends over to
	primitives.pure.

	* examples/rules.pure: Reworked to use the new 'reduce' primitive.

	* lib/strings.pure: Add new 'reduce' primitive. (This should
	actually be moved to primitives.pure in the future, along with
	'eval' et al.)

	* lib/primitives.pure: Add documentation of new '__locals__'
	builtin.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc, symtable.cc: Add a new '__locals__'
	builtin and a new primitive 'reduce' which make it possible to
	inspect and dynamically apply local function environments. This
	provides a limited form of dynamic environments needed to
	implement something like Mathematica's 'ReplaceAll' function and
	local rule sets in an efficient way, which has been a hot topic on
	the mailing list.

2009-08-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (parse_simple): Check for missing operands at end
	of parse. Reported by Max Wolf.

2009-08-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.27 release.

	* lexer.ll (checktag): Bugfix in the new type tag resolution routine.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* lexer.ll: Fixed a critical bug in the lexer which would cause
	any global qualid of the form ::foo to be mistaken for a type tag.
	Also made it possible to specify a qualid as a type tag.

	To make this work, qualid/type tag resolution requires a more
	stringent syntax. The construct 'foo::bar' still works both ways,
	depending on whether 'foo' is a valid namespace or not. But if
	either the variable or the type tag is a qualid then whitespace
	must be used around the '::' symbol separating variable and type
	tag; otherwise the construct is always assumed to be a simple
	qualid. (In fact, it is sufficient to place a blank after the '::'
	separator. But note that something like '::foo...' will always be
	interpreted as an absolute qualid, thus placing whitespace in
	front of the separator alone isn't sufficient.)

2009-08-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.26 release.

	* examples/rules.pure: Added example.

	* lib/*.pure: Rename the 'C' namespace in various standard library
	modules to '__C', to prevent potential clashes with type tags on
	the variable 'C'.

2009-08-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, interpreter.cc (mksym_expr): Allow the type tag
	notation x::bar for any function or nonfix symbol bar as a
	shorthand for the "as" pattern x@(bar _).

	* symtable.cc, lib/prelude.pure: Overhaul the standard operator
	system so that it becomes easy for the programmer to sneak in
	additional levels. There are now 20 standard precedence levels
	which are numbered from 1000 to 2900, see prelude.pure for
	details. The relative precedences aren't changed, so most existing
	scripts should be unaffected, but of course you may have to adjust
	the precedences of your own operator declarations accordingly.

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, parserdefs.hh, interpreter.cc/hh, expr.hh,
	runtime.h: Added support for an essentially unlimited number of
	precedence levels.

	The Bison parser now delegates the parsing of simple expressions
	to a second operator precedence parser (based on Dijkstra's
	"shunting yard" algorithm, with some modifications to deal with
	unary prefix and postfix operators) which can handle an unlimited
	number of precedence levels and rearranges a list of preparsed
	primaries and operator symbols on the fly.

	This has the nice side effect that it simplifies the Bison grammar
	considerably. It also fixes various quirks due to parsing
	conflicts and the messy symbol precedences in the old Bison
	grammar. Error messages for syntax errors in simple expressions
	are now slightly more informative as well. Parsing speed hasn't
	suffered, AFAICT.

	The parser still imposes a limit on the number of precedence
	levels, but this has now been set to a very large value, 16777216
	a.k.a. 24 bit (this is about what's possible so that "normalized
	precedence" a.k.a. combined precedence and fixity values still fit
	into 32 bit signed integers). This should be large enough for
	anything I can imagine.

2009-08-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (fixity): Fixed wrong return value of fixity for
	non-symbol arguments.

	* runtime.h: Made the maximum precedence a symbolic constant so
	that it can be changed easily when needed.

	* lexer.ll: Catch end of file while parsing comment. Reported by
	Eddie Rucker.

2009-08-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, matcher.cc, printer.cc: Work around segfaults in
	some obscure corner cases where runtime data gets injected into
	the lhs of a rule by means of a nonfix const symbol. At present
	such rules are just ignored (possibly flagging them as unused);
	we might want to add better diagnostics at some point, though.

	* printer.cc: Cosmetic change in printing of 'when' bindings. We
	now omit the lhs if it is just '_'.

2009-07-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* expr.hh, symtable.cc, interpreter.cc, runtime.cc, lexer.ll,
	parser.yy, pure.cc: Replace 'nullary' keyword with 'nonfix', which
	is more in line with the other fixity keywords, as suggested by
	John Cowan. Pure sources and the syntax highlighting files have
	been updated accordingly.

	This is supposed to alleviate the confusion surrounding the notion
	of nullary symbols, which is merely a syntactic attribute, but has
	no consequences on the actual number of arguments the symbol may
	expect.

	For the time being, the 'nullary' keyword continues to work, but
	is deprecated and the compiler will warn about it.

2009-07-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/hh, lib/primitives.pure: Renamed 'arity' to 'nargs',
	and added two new functions 'arity' and 'fixity' to determine the
	arity and precedence/fixity of a symbol. As discussed on the
	mailing list.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Fix up invalid debugger call in
	case the call of an external failed. Reported by John Cowan.

	* symtable.cc (visible): Fix up symbol visibility check. Bug
	reported by Eddie Rucker.

	* interpreter.cc (interpreter): Fix up symbol table initialization
	for standalone executables.

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Fix up completion routines so that they work
	with the hierarchical namespaces feature.

2009-07-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* printer.cc: Get rid again of the extra quote printed
	automatically in front of (symbolic) matrices with nested
	submatrices, as this is inconsistent with the treatment of other
	quoted matrices. Thus, when storing such a matrix in textual form,
	you'll have to add one extra quote if you want to preserve the
	original structure when rereading the matrix.

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, printer.cc, interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc,
	expr.hh, symtable.hh: Added support for 'outfix' operators which
	let you declare pairs of custom bracket symbols. This was adopted
	from Wm Leler's Bertrand language.

2009-07-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy: Allow qualified module names in 'using' clauses, as
	suggested by Eddie Rucker. These are translated to filenames by
	replacing the "::" symbol with the path separator "/", which makes
	it possible to package libraries in their own subdirectories.

	Note that the pathname components must be legal Pure identifiers
	to make this work. E.g., 'using examples::hello;' will try to load
	'hello.pure' from the 'examples' subdirectory. The module is
	searched on the library paths as usual. To bypass the search
	mechanism, you can also specify an absolute qualid, such as
	'::usr::lib::pure::foo' which translates to the absolute pathname
	'/usr/lib/pure/foo.pure'.

2009-07-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* symtable.cc, lexer.ll, parser.yy: Implemented hierarchical
	namespaces, as suggested by Max Wolf.

	Namespaces of the form 'foo::bar::gnu' are now supported, and both
	unqualified and qualified symbols are now looked up in the current
	and the search namespaces. Generalizing the notation '::foo' to
	denote a symbol in the default namespace, an absolute qualifier
	'::foo::bar' can be used to denote a symbol in a specific
	namespace, bypassing the name search mechanism. Also note that for
	safety reasons, it is now an error if an undeclared qualified
	symbol is used outside its home namespace (this used to be a
	warning before).

2009-07-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (const_value): Bugfixes in constant
	computations. Quoted matrices are now handled properly again.

	* interpreter.cc: Handle both 'quote' and its synonym (') in the
	code generator. This works around some corner cases where (')
	wasn't expanded to 'quote'. Consequently, (') now doesn't need to
	be defined as a macro any more, and the corresponding definition
	was removed from prelude.pure.

2009-07-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Added optimized code for numeric
	and symbolic (bigint, string) matrix constants.

	* runtime.cc/hh: Added support for constructing various special
	types of list, tuple and matrix values to the runtime.

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Placed the list/tuple code generation
	into a separate list_codegen method. Added optimized code for
	string list and tuple constants.

2009-07-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* printer.cc: Prevent stack overflows when printing large lists
	and tuples.

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Optimize the case of list and tuples
	of bigint constants. These are now encoded as constant arrays in
	the output code, in a manner similar to int/double list and tuple
	constants (see below). Also fixed up various places where large
	tuples would cause segfaults.

2009-07-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): llvmc needs to be invoked with -opt
	-Wo,-tailcallelim to enable tail call optimization.

	* expr.cc (~EXPR): Workarounds to avoid stack overflows when
	destroying deep compile time expressions. Specifically, the case of
	right-recursive application structures is now done iteratively, so
	that big list constants are handled gracefully. In other cases,
	PURE_STACK is obeyed to prune the recursion when nesting becomes
	too deep.

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Optimize the case of list and tuples
	of int and double constants. These can be encoded as constant
	arrays in the output code.

	* interpreter.cc (const_value): Handle the case of improper list
	values.

2009-07-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Change generated code for list and
	tuple constants to use pure_listv/pure_tuplev instead of
	pure_listl/pure_tuplel, to avoid stack overflows on large values.
	Also make use of pure_listv2 to construct improper list values.

2009-07-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_debug_rule): Rework the expression evaluation
	command in the debugger so that it doesn't need the parser to
	construct the local variable bindings, but constructs a suitable
	compile time expression in a direct fashion instead. This makes
	the command work with arbitrary local values, including pointers
	and local functions which don't have a parsable representation.

	* expr.cc, interpreter.cc, printer.cc: Allow run time expressions
	to be wrapped up in a dummy compile time expression which resolves
	to a global variable reference when compiled. This enables the
	compiler to handle expressions containing arbitrary run time data,
	removing any corresponding limitations of 'const' definitions and
	'eval' parameters. Note however, that this only works in scripts
	run in the interpreter. As before, constant data to be used in
	batch-compiled programs may not contain any non-null pointers or
	local closures (otherwise the batch compiler will spit out an
	error message).

2009-07-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (const_defn): We don't keep the code generated
	for 'const' definitions when batch-compiling any more; this seemed
	to be rather wasteful. Note that this means that batch-compiled
	programs shouldn't rely on side-effects of the code executed to
	compute a constant value any more, but this seems to be a
	reasonable assumption anyway.

	* expr.cc, interpreter.cc: Various optimizations so that the
	interpreter doesn't run out of stack space for large list
	constants.

2009-07-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy: Add rules for left and right operator sections to the
	primary expression syntax. Thus you can now write '(x+)' for '(+)
	x' and '(+x)' for 'flip (+) x', respectively. (Note that since the
	expression printer has no special support for printing sections
	yet, the latter representations will be used for printing.)

	* interpreter.cc/hh: Add new mklsect/mkrsect operations for
	constructing operator sections. mklsect is in fact just the same
	as mkexpr, while mkrsect employs the 'flip' combinator to
	implement right sections of the form '(+x) === flip (+) x'.
	mkrsect also handles the case of unary minus in parentheses, to
	make up for some syntactic ambiguities.

	* symtable.cc/hh: Add 'flip' to the predefined symbols, so that we
	can use it for implementing operator sections.

2009-07-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.html, purelib.html: Regenerated docs using the latest
	pure-doc from svn.

	* preamble.tex: Added a preamble with some definitions to make the
	pdf versions of the manuals look nicer. This now gets included in
	the LaTeX source generated by rst2latex (see also below).

	* Makefile.in (%.tex): Sanitize LaTeX docs using fixdoc from the
	pure-doc package. Also added a bunch of options to rst2latex to
	make the pdf output look nicer. A separate cleandocs option is now
	provided to clean up generated documentation files.

2009-07-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Added the necessary configure checks for readdir
	et al.

	* runtime.cc/h, system.pure: Added readdir() to the system
	interface. Contributed by Jiri Spitz.

2009-07-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Fix up quoted applications. These were
	evaluated in some cases where the head referred to a local function.

	* interpreter.cc (promote_ttags, builtin_codegen): Builtin
	arithmetic must not be applied if operations are redefined
	locally.

2009-07-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (same): Two local functions must have the same
	environment bindings in order to be considered equal.

	* interpreter.cc/h, runtime.cc/h: Add a key field to closures
	which, for local functions, holds a unique key identifying the
	closure which is used by the same() function to compare function
	objects. This resolves a bug which would cause different instances
	of the same local function appear to be different based on
	function pointer comparisons, due to the way the JIT handles lazy
	compilation.

	Please note that this required some changes in the internal
	runtime API. Existing modules have to be recompiled.

2009-07-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (add_rule): Check for qualified head symbols in
	local definitions ('with' clause). These now properly raise an
	error in the parser.

	* interpreter.cc (fsubst): Check for qualified function and
	operator symbols, so that they are not mistaken for locally
	defined functions.

	* lexer.ll: Keep track of qualified operator symbols, so that
	these can be handled properly in a context where the same symbol
	is redefined locally.

2009-06-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Bumped version number to 0.26. Also
	bumped the runtime library version to 3.0, to account for changes
	in the internal runtime API, see below. (Needs reconfigure.)

	* printer.cc (operator <<): Handle the case of improper list
	values. This case needs to be optimized, too, to prevent the
	printer from checking for proper lists over and over again,
	leading to quadratic complexity. Reported by John Cowan.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/h: Eliminate the 'thunked' flag,
	which wasn't really needed, from the closure data structure. This
	also fixes a bug where thunked closures in literal applications
	weren't executed when they got reapplied in a different context.

	Please note that this required some changes in the internal
	runtime API. Existing modules have to be recompiled.

2009-06-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Re-added definition of the rdynamic flag which got
	lost somewhere along the way. Hence configure --disable-shared now
	produces a working interpreter again. Reported by Sergej Winitzki.

2009-06-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.25 release.

	* pure.cc (main): Pass on error codes encountered during batch
	compilation. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Do some error checking on the return
	value of system().

2009-06-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_listv): Bugfix in list construction:
	constructor equations in (:) weren't handled, causing wrong normal
	forms when entering lists as a toplevel expression. Reported by
	John Cowan.

	* runtime.cc (matrix_double, matrix_complex, matrix_int): Add
	missing symbolic -> numeric matrix conversions.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Add iteraten function. Suggested by Libor
	Spacek. Also renamed 'while' to 'iterwhile'.

2009-06-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_call): Add another stack test to catch some
	more stack fault cases. Reported by John Cowan.

2009-06-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Change 'clear lastx' to 'clear ans'.

	* lib/strings.pure: Rename 'lastx' to 'ans', which is more
	convenient and familiar from calculators.

	* runtime.cc: Rename lastx() to lastres().

2009-06-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in, et al: Add syntax highlighting of new
	int8/16/32/64 types.

	* lib/system.pure: Fix wrong prototypes of fread, fwrite.

	* runtime.cc (pure_fprintf, pure_sprintf): Back out changes from
	r1509, which inadvertently broke the fprintf/sprintf routines in
	system.pure when the format string contains embedded '%%'
	literals.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added a new uint64 function for 64 bit
	conversions, and fixed up ulong so that it is a synonym for uint
	or uint64, depending on the size of the C long type on the host
	architecture.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Bumped version number to 0.25. Also
	bumped the runtime library version to 2.0, to account for 'long'
	related changes breaking backward compatibility, see below. (Needs
	reconfigure.)

2009-06-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.h/cc, interpreter.cc: C interface changes as discussed
	on the mailing list. 'long' is now a 32 or 64 bit integer type,
	depending on the architecture. This incurs various changes in the
	runtime and the library:

	- pure_long, pure_get_long (internal API) are renamed to
	pure_int64, pure_get_int64, respectively.

	- pointer_get_long, pointer_put_long now use long integers,
	pointer_get_int64, pointer_put_int64 are provided to deal with 64
	bit integers. This affects lib/primitives.pure.

	- int8, int16, int32 are now available as synonyms for char,
	short, int, respectively, and int64 denotes true 64 bit
	integers. The time-related functions in lib/system.pure were
	modified accordingly.

2009-06-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (check): Disabled the check for symbols which might be
	interactive commands. This was rather annoying and not 100%
	foolproof anyway.

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Add 'clear lastx' command which clears the
	'lastx' value.

2009-06-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (exec): Keep track of the most recent result
	printed by the interpreter in interactive mode. This value is
	accessible using the new prelude function 'lastx' (implemented in
	runtime.cc). Suggested by John Cowan.

2009-06-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc (main): Make the "Couldn't find the prelude" message
	stick out, as suggested by harshad.rj (Issue #10).

2009-05-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.24 release.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number (needs reconfigure).

	* runtime.cc (pure_double_seq): Fix up double sequence to prevent
	funny results due to rounding errors. Specifically, the boundary
	condition is now x <= bound+0.5*step for positive step, and x >=
	bound+0.5*step for negative step, respectively, like in
	Haskell98. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2009-05-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Some additions and cosmetic changes in the runtime
	API, as requested by John Cowan.

2009-05-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.23 release.

	* lib/quasiquote.pure, lib/quasiquote2.pure: Moved quasiquote
	modules back into the library.

2009-05-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/quasiquote2.pure: Fixed up macro implementation of
	quasiquote.

	* examples/quasiquote.pure: Complete overhaul of quasiquote, to
	fix various bugs and make nested quasiquotes work.

2009-05-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (csubst): Handle the quote, so that constant
	substitution is now inhibited in quoted subterms.

	* examples/quasiquote.pure: Fix up quasiquote to make it more
	robust and to properly handle splices and embedded matrices.

	* interpreter.cc (exec, define, define_const): Fix up diagnostics
	for unhandled exceptions, so that we always print the original
	rather than the parsed and processed expression or rule.

2009-05-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (macsubst): Handle the quote, so that macro
	substitution is now inhibited in quoted subterms.

2009-05-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy: Fix up error handling for invalid precedence level in
	operator declaration. Reported by John Cowan.

	* printer.cc: Print (symbolic) matrices with nested submatrices as
	quoted matrices, so that they can be reconstructed properly from
	their textual representation.

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Properly implement quoted
	matrices. This means that the implicit splicing of nested
	submatrices is now inhibited for quoted matrices. To support this,
	new quoted matrix constructions operations (pure_matrix_rowsq,
	pure_matrix_columnsq) have been added to the internal API in
	runtime.cc.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number (needs reconfigure).

	* Makefile.in: Bump version number of the runtime library (needs
	reconfigure).

	* runtime.cc, interpreter.cc: Move pure_unref() calls to
	pure_free_args, pure_pop_args and friends, in order to save an
	extra function call in the function epilog.

	* interpreter.cc (CreateRet): Overhaul stack cleanup for (pseudo)
	tail calls to internal functions, so that cleanup of arguments
	isn't done too early. This prevents segfaults in some obscure
	cases where an internal function like pure_matrix_rows() returns
	one of its arguments as its result.

2009-05-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure, lib/primitives.pure: Added 'x as syntactic
	sugar for quote x.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Moved quasiquote back to
	examples/quasiquote.pure for now. It's not really clear how this
	should be implemented in Pure and the current version has some
	bugs, so it shouldn't be in the library.

2009-05-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure, lib/matrices.pure: Change matrix transposition
	operator (x') to a function (transpose x).

	* INSTALL: Update installation instructions for x86-32/64
	(--enable-pic is the default for LLVM from svn, which causes
	breakage on x86-32; the Ubuntu 9.04 package for LLVM 2.5 is broken
	on x86-32 for similar reasons).

2009-05-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Add missing #ifdefs for testing GSL support and fix
	a few compiler warnings produced by some recent gcc versions.
	Reported by Max Wolf.

2009-05-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_force): Bigint values have to be copied when
	forcing a thunk. Reported by 'asitdepends'.

2009-05-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Add better readline check. (On some systems
	readline needs additional libraries.) Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2009-04-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (get_vars): Bugfix in debugger: treatment of empty
	shadow stack frames.

2009-04-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure, lib/strings.pure, runtime.cc/h: Faster
	implementations of common special cases of finite arithmetic
	sequences using C routines in the runtime.

2009-04-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Use the BROWSER environment variable to
	determine the help browser if PURE_HELP is not set. Suggested by
	John Cowan. See http://www.catb.org/~esr/BROWSER/.

2009-04-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fixed up arithmetic sequences so that they
	properly deal with character data and all infinite cases.

	* runtime.cc (pure_debug_redn): Bugfixes in debugger.

2009-04-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.22 release.

2009-04-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Add support for showing external calls in the
	debugger and setting breakpoints on them.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number. (Needs reconfigure.)

	* runtime.cc: Finish off debugger (stack navigation, eval, shell
	escape, readline support).

2009-04-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Add some convenient debugger commands. Type 'h' in
	the debugger for a list of these.

2009-03-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc (main): Add -g option to enable debugging support.

	* runtime.cc/h, interpreter.cc/h: Basic symbolic debugger
	support. This is still experimental.

2009-03-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (init): Set a name on Pure's incarnation of the
	'void' type. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2009-03-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.21 release.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Bugfixes, add support for creating
	native object (.o) files.

2009-03-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (run): Bugfix: When searching for a dynamic
	library, prefer dll names with the proper filename extension, for
	the sake of the batch compiler.

2009-03-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc (main), interpreter.cc (compiler): Windows compatibility
	fixes.

2009-03-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (subst): Bugfix: Qualified identifiers could be
	mistaken for a lhs variable if the qualifier was empty.

	* printer.cc (printx): Bugfix: Make sure that qualids explicitly
	specified in the source are printed as such, even if the qualifier
	is empty.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Add PURE_COPT environment variable
	which allows to pass extra compilation options to llvmc.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Add missing C compiler config, which
	is needed to compile pure_main.c.

	* Makefile.in: Add proper versioning for the runtime library.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Cosmetic changes in build
	system. Move various platform-specific defaults from configure to
	Makefile.in, so that they can be edited more easily. (Needs
	reconfigure.)

2009-03-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (fun_prolog): Mangle operator names so that funny
	function names like '.' don't wreak havoc with static linkage.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Add loaded libraries (using
	"lib:...") to the compile command so that scripts importing
	dynamic libraries are linked properly.

	* configure.ac: Make --disable-versioned the default. This makes
	it easier for package maintainers.

2009-03-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc, interpreter.cc (compiler): Add -l option to add
	libraries to be linked in batch compilation. Also, -v0x40 turns on
	verbose compilation, which prints the llvmc command and passes -v
	to llvmc so that it also prints the commands it executes.

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Applied Michel Salim's patch for gcc 4.4 from
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488563.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number. (Needs reconfigure.)

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Dump the table of externals so that
	it can be reconstructed at runtime along with the symbol
	table. This is needed so that externals work as expected with
	eval.

2009-03-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (const_value, const_app_value): Fix up doeval()
	so that at least simple evals work if the global environment is
	not fully initialized.

	* lib/system.pure: Remove unneeded extern 'gets', which prompts
	gcc to print its "gets is dangerous" warning.

	* runtime.cc (pure_throw): Give proper feedback for exceptions
	without handler, in case we're running on the bare metal.

	* parser.yy: Make sure that we don't execute any parse actions
	that aren't possible when running in restricted mode. Currently
	this precludes pretty much everything related to 'eval', except
	evaluation of simple toplevel expressions. In other words,
	anything which changes the executing program is forbidden in
	restricted mode.

	* interpreter.cc: Add a 'restricted' flag which indicates whether
	we're running on the bare metal, i.e., as a batch-compiled
	standalone module.

	* Makefile.in: Add rules to build pure_main.o and install it in
	the Pure library directory, for the sake of the batch compiler.

	* pure_main.c: Added to distribution. This is a minimal main() to
	be used with the batch compiler.

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Add a simple llvmc driver.

	If the output file specified with -o is either '-' (stdout) or a
	filename ending with the .ll extension, the generated output is a
	plain LLVM assembler file which can be processed manually with the
	LLVM tools. Otherwise we assume that the user wants a native
	executable, and llvmc is invoked automagically to create one. By
	default, if no output filename is specified, we assume the
	customary 'a.out' for the name of the executable.

	NOTE: This requires the LLVM tools (llvm-gcc, llvmc etc.) to be
	installed.

	* runtime.cc (pure_interp_main), interpreter.cc (interpreter):
	Added the rest of the missing initialization code. Programs
	compile and run now (no working eval, though, since this requires
	parts of the runtime system which aren't implemented on the bare
	metal right now).

	* symtable.cc (restore): Added the code to initialize the symbol
	table from a previous dump.

2009-03-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (compiler): Added a main entry point, void
	__pure_main__ (int argc, char **argv), to be called by the main()
	or other initialization code of the standalone module. It takes
	two arguments, the argc and argv of the interpreter. Also added
	the necessary infrastructure in the runtime (pure_interp_main
	routine) to initialize the standalone interpreter instance. This
	still has to be implemented, though.

2009-03-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (init_sys_vars): Add new system variable
	'compiling' which holds a truth value indicating whether the
	executing program is actually being batch-compiled (-c option).

	Note that even when batch-compiling, the compiled program is
	executed as usual. This is necessary because some parts of the
	program (in particular, const values, and thereby pretty much
	anything else) may depend on previous computations performed while
	the program is being compiled. The 'compiling' flag gives the
	program an indication whether it is running under the auspices of
	the batch compiler, so that it can adjust accordingly.

	* pure.cc, interpreter.cc: Add basic infrastructure for batch
	compilation. This already generates compilable LLVM assembler code
	but the code isn't usable yet because the runtime support is still
	missing.

	New interpreter options:
	
	-c triggers batch compilation. This is ignored if -i is specified.

	-o filename specifies the LLVM assembler (.ll) output filename.

2009-03-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.20 release.

	* matcher.cc: Fix a bug in TA generation which would errorneously
	merge a constant transition with *any* var transition in the state
	if it happens to be the first one, even if the type doesn't
	match. Reported by John Cowan.

2009-03-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Overhaul of arity function. It will now
	consistently yield -1 for all non-function objects, including pure
	constructors and their applications, as well as over-saturated
	unevaluated applications of real closures. Zero is returned also
	for saturated unevaluated applications of real closures.

	* pure.cc (main): Only rebind termination signals to Pure
	exceptions when running interactively.

2009-03-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (dodefn): Bugfix in 'let', constant rhs case. We
	must match against the translated pure_expr* rather than the
	original rhs to get proper results if the rhs involves nontrivial
	variable substitutions and the lhs reaches inside of these. Added
	the necessary support for that to matcher.cc/hh.

2009-03-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.19 release.

	* lib/*.pure: Finished marking up comments for the library
	documentation.

	* lib/system.pure: Various bugfixes in the regex functions.

2009-03-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added charp predicate which tests for
	single character strings.

2009-03-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_sym): Make it possible to resolve private
	symbols.

2009-03-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/*.pure: Started marking up comments for the library
	documentation.

	* runtime.cc/, lib/primitives.pure: Add a function 'arity' which
	determines how many arguments a closure or partial application
	expects.

2009-03-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/matrices.pure: Overhaul matrix comprehensions so that the
	block layout of component matrices is preserved.

	Previously a matrix comprehension would lay out elements using
	alternating row and column generation in the same fashion as with
	list generators, ignoring the layout of the component matrices and
	essentially treating them like flat lists. This was rather
	counter-intuitive. With the new implementation, the block layout
	of the component matrices is preserved, so that an expression like
	{x,y|x={1,2;3,4};y={a,b;c,d}} now yields the expected layout:

	{(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b);
	 (1,c),(1,d),(2,c),(2,d);
	 (3,a),(3,b),(4,a),(4,b);
	 (3,c),(3,d),(4,c),(4,d)}

	Note that this implies that you *must* specify the layout through
	the component matrices; an expression like {x,y|x={1,2};y={a,b}}
	will produce just a flat rowvector now. For list generators, the
	alternating row and column generation is still in effect, so that
	{x,y|x=[1,2];y=[a,b]} still produces a square matrix, as does
	{x,y|x={1;2};y={a,b}}.

	Also note that it is now possible that a matrix comprehension
	involving filters fails because the filtered result isn't a
	rectangular matrix any more. E.g., {2*x|x={1,2,3,-4};x>0} still
	works, as does {2*x|x={-1,2;3,-4};x>0}, but {2*x|x={1,2;3,-4};x>0}
	looses because the rows of the result matrix have different lengths.

	* interpreter.cc, prelude: Optimizations in list and matrix
	comprehensions to take advantage of efficient matrix operations
	where possible (experimental).

	Simple matrix comprehensions like {2*x|x={1,2;3,4}} now translate
	to just a plain 'map' so that they fully benefit from the speedups
	in the matrix map operation. Matrix comps involving multiple
	generators and/or filters still require intermediate (symbolic
	matrix) results, but avoid conversions from/to lists where
	possible and thus run considerably faster, too. The same kinds of
	optimizations are also applied to list comps, but there the
	effects on performance will not be quite as prominent.

2009-03-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/matrices.pure, runtime.cc/h: Merged (and completed) Scott
	Dillard's optimized matrix operations from the matrix_opt branch,
	resulting in major speedups in these operations (usually 10x or
	more).

	* configure.ac: Bump version number. (Needs reconfigure.)

2009-03-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll (docmd): Switch help reader to html browser
	(w3m by default, this can be changed with the PURE_HELP
	environment variable).

2009-02-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_symbol): Handle the case of a symbol bound to
	an external. In this case we need to return the value or fbox
	associated with the external rather than the value of the symbol
	itself.

2009-02-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.18 release.

	* interpreter.cc (varsubst): Eliminate unneeded macval calls.
	(macred): Fix up deBruijn indices if a catch clause or thunk is
	created during macro expansion. Fixes regression test030.pure.

2009-02-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, interpreter.cc/hh: Permit 'public' and 'private'
	before an 'extern' declaration.

	* runtime.cc (mk_pair): Bugfix: Normalize tuples on the fly, so
	that constant tuples in toplevel expressions are correctly
	computed.

	* lexer.ll: Bugfix: Keep track of line count in strings.

2009-02-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number. (Needs reconfigure.)

	* pure.1.in: Removed, pure.1 isn't generated any more.

	* lexer.ll: Reworked the lexical analyzer so that it doesn't use
	REJECT any more. This improves performance and allows the input
	buffer to be resized dynamically, so that the lexer doesn't choke
	on big tokens.

2009-02-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Add alternate forms of the 'show' command to list
	current/search namespaces ('show namespace') as well as all
	currently declared namespaces ('show namespaces').

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Fix up completion routines so that namespaces
	are taken into account.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Strop external wrapper names
	with namespace prefix, to avoid name collisions in assembler code.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern), runtime.cc/h: Add automatic
	conversions of matrices to short*, int*, float*, double* and void*
	arguments in the C interface.

2009-02-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/spawn.pure: Added example showing the use of the argv
	routines in conjunction with execvp.

	* lib/strings.pure: Add convenience functions for dealing with
	argv-like string vectors.

	* Makefile.in (install): Avoid clobbering the install dir when
	installing over an existing installation. This would remove all
	installed modules when reinstalling a new Pure version which in
	most cases is unneccessary and in fact rather annoying. If you
	really need to clean out the installation directory, run 'make
	uninstall' first.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Moved malloc and friends from system.pure,
	and added a convenience function to create cooked pointers which
	take care of freeing themselves.

2009-02-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/getopt.pure: Added getopt module (ported from Q).

	* interpreter.cc (varsubst): Fix a bug in the substitution of
	macro parameters containing local bindings.

2009-01-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.17 release.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/system.pure: Overhaul of time functions to
	make them more POSIXish. Note that localtime and gmtime now return
	broken-down time as a pointer which can then be passed to asctime
	or strftime to format it as a string, or to int_matrix 9 if you
	want to have the data as a matrix. Also updated Libor Spacek's
	date.pure example accordingly.

2009-01-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number. (Needs reconfigure.)

	* runtime.cc: Fix a severe performance issue with mass updates of
	reference counts, which affected, in particular, the creation of
	symbolic matrices. Reported by Scott E. Dillard.

2009-01-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/matrices.pure: Added direct list->rowvector
	conversions to the dmatrix, imatrix, cmatrix and smatrix
	functions. These are typically much faster than the generic
	'matrix' routine, but require that the list elements are already
	of the appropriate types.

2009-01-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): For convenience, move the definition
	of the SIZEOF constants to interpreter::init_sys_vars, so that
	they are always defined, without loading the system module.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/matrices.pure: Added numeric-symbolic matrix
	conversions (smatrix et al).

	* lib/system.pure: Bugfix: Memory allocation functions take size_t
	arguments, not int.

2009-01-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_is_tuplev): Bugfix: Return zero elements for
	the empty tuple.

2009-01-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Windows/Mingw only: Invoke diff with
	--strip-trailing-cr to make 'make check' work. Previously these
	tests would fail when using the svn sources because of lf/cr-lf
	discrepancies. NOTE: This requires MSYS 1.0.11 or later since
	earlier versions ship an older diff utility which doesn't have the
	--strip-trailing-cr option. If you're still running MSYS 1.0.10,
	you can download a separate package with the 1.0.11 diffutils from
	http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=24963.

	* configure.ac: Avoid overriding user-defined CPPFLAGS (reported
	by Ryan Schmidt), minor fixes for compatibility with autoconf 2.63.

	* examples/transitive.pure: Added Vili Aapro's infinite transitive
	closure example.

2009-01-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (CreateRet): Fix compile problems with LLVM 2.3.

2009-01-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/primitives.pure: Add addr function to get the
	addresses of extern C symbols at runtime.

2009-01-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in (check): Keep diffs of failed checks so that they
	can be reported to maintainers.

2009-01-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (run): Fix index wraparound in check for library
	suffix. Reported by Scott E. Dillard.

2009-01-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.16 release.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Add missing fallback rule for (&) operator.

2009-01-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/system.pure: Make fopen/popen fail in case of error. This
	fixes issue #5 reported by Scott E. Dillard. In addition,
	setlocale now also fails on error. Note that previously all these
	functions used to return null pointers in case of an error
	condition, which would cause grief if the unchecked result value
	was then passed to other system routines.

2009-01-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (const_value): Fix up broken test for proper list
	and tuple values, so that constant lists and tuples are properly
	recognized as constants and aren't compiled any more. Reported by
	Scott E. Dillard.

2009-01-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* symtable.cc: Fix symbol table overflow (space in table was only
	reserved, but the table was never actually resized). Reported by
	Scott E. Dillard.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number. (Needs reconfigure.)

2009-01-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile.in: Fix LD_LIBRARY_PATH in check and logs targets, so
	that an existing LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the environment is kept. Fixes
	issue #4 reported by sam666mu...@live.com.

	* parserdefs.hh, lexerdefs.hh: Added new header files to properly
	handle interdependencies between parser, lexer and interpreter, to
	make bison 2.4 happy without breaking support for earlier bison
	versions. Modified parser.yy, lexer.ll and interpreter.cc/hh
	accordingly. This fixes issue #3 reported by mikko.sysikaski, as
	well as a MacPorts compatibility issue already reported by Ryan
	Schmidt some time ago.

2009-01-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/binarytrees.pure: Add Alioth binary-trees benchmark.

2009-01-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (same): Make syntactic comparisons of applications
	tail-recursive, so that we do not run out of stack space when
	comparing large lists or similar right-recursive structures.

	* matcher.cc (merge_ftrans): Fix bug in transition ordering.
	Reported by Vili Aapro.

2008-12-20    <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/matrices.pure: Add missing matrix-tuple conversions.

2008-12-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.h/c, lib/primitives.pure: Add missing pointer_get_long
	and pointer_put_long functions.

2008-12-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.15 release.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* interpreter.cc, parser.yy, printer.cc, expr.cc: Local
	definitions (when, with) may now span the right-hand side and the
	guard of a rule.

2008-12-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_apply): Fix a bug which would cause results to
	be garbage-collected together with a temporary closure, if the
	result happens to be in the environment of the closure.

2008-12-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* symtable.cc: Fix a one-off bug in resizing the symbol table
	which caused segfaults in programs with lots of symbols. Reported
	by Eddie Rucker.

2008-11-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.14 release.

	* interpreter.cc (cond, toplevel_cond): Fix wrong code ('ret' in
	the middle of a basic code block) which was generated for bad
	constant guards in if-then-else expressions. Reported by Eddie
	Rucker.

2008-11-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in: Minor bugfixes, update syntax highlighting
	rules (additional 'namespace' and 'public' keywords). The other
	syntax highlighting files in etc/ have been updated as well.

2008-11-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* symtable.cc, interpreter.cc, parser.yy, lexer.ll, runtime.cc:
	Implement new namespace support, as dicussed on the mailing list.
	NOTE: This requires adaption of sources which use 'private'
	symbols because these only work in named namespaces now.

2008-11-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll: Add support for 'public' declarations.
	These work like 'private' declarations, but explicitly declare
	public symbols instead.

2008-11-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* configure.ac: Check for new template arguments of the IRBuilder
	class (LLVM 2.4). Reported by Ryan Schmidt. NOTE: This change
	requires a reconfigure.

2008-11-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Added the U+20D0 to U+20FF block (Combining
	Diacritical Marks for Symbols) to the special symbols.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): Add the SIZEOF_SIZE_T constant.

	* interpreter.cc (named_type): Add support for the 'size_t'
	integer type, which is 4 bytes on 32 bit, and 8 bytes on 64 bit
	systems.

2008-11-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.13 release.

	* interpreter.cc (error, warning): Simplified format for error and
	warning messages, which also eliminates bogus column numbers in
	messages when parsing UTF8-encoded source.

	* lexer.ll: Improved Unicode support. As proposed by John Cowan,
	extended characters in operator symbols are now restricted to
	symbols U+00A1 through U+00BF, U+00D7, U+00F7 and U+2100 through
	U+2BFF. As John points out, this covers almost everything you'd
	ever want to use in operator symbols, while still being easy to
	implement in an 8-bit lexer. All other Unicode characters are now
	usable in ordinary identifiers just like any ASCII letter, which
	permits writing Pure programs in almost any language.

	In addition, interactive input is now converted from the system
	encoding to the internal UTF-8 format automagically. Note that
	script files are still read as they are, and thus must be encoded
	in either 7 bit ASCII or UTF-8.

2008-11-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* symtable.cc, lib/prelude.pure et al: Swapped the logical and
	bitwise negation operators, so that the logical and bitwise
	operations are now consistently named ~, &&, || and not/and/or,
	respectively, as discussed on the mailing list. In addition,
	renamed '!=' and '!==' to '~=' and '~==' for consistency.

2008-10-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_interp_compile): Experimental API for eager
	compilation. This is supposed to be useful for applications where
	incremental compilation is not appropriate, but it also increases
	startup times since it compiles all definitions no matter whether
	they are actually used by the running program or not.
	Unfortunately, with the current LLVM JIT this is quite slow and
	thus of limited usefulness at this time.

2008-10-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: list (x:xs) wasn't tail-recursive. Reported by
	Max Wolf.

2008-10-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Added two public interface ops as convenience
	functions to evaluate expressions and commands given as strings
	(pure_eval, pure_evalcmd). The former replaces the old version of
	eval() which took a string argument previously. Fixed up the
	poor.c example accordingly.

2008-10-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure.nanorc: Added Pure syntax highlighting for GNU nano
	(http://www.nano-editor.org). Contributed by Eddie Rucker.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Fixed the rational, real and exactness
	predicates so that they do the right thing when math.pure is not
	loaded. This was reported by Eddie Rucker. Also added the integerp
	predicate which checks for machine int and bigint values.

2008-10-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fix definition of tuple equality so that it
	properly handles comparisons with a singleton. Reported by Eddie
	Rucker.

	* lib/math.pure: Move additional syntactic number predicates to
	primitives.pure. Also fixed a bug in the exactp/inexactp
	predicates which would return false for exact complex numbers in
	polar representation.

	* interpreter.cc (pure_expr_to_expr): Bugfixes in construction of
	const matrices.

2008-10-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* symtable.hh/cc, interpreter.cc, printer.cc, runtime.cc: Handle
	complex_rect_sym() and complex_polar_sym() like the other
	predefined symbols. Update interpreter, printer and runtime
	accordingly.

	* lib/math.pure: Moved complex and rational constructors to
	prelude.pure. This simplifies the handling of these symbols in the
	interpreter where they are needed in some situations where
	math.pure may not be loaded (yet).

	* lexer.ll: Selection of show/dump/clear was missing temporary
	rules of non-temporary symbols when specifying symbols explicitly.

2008-10-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_force): Fix a segfault related to thunk
	procedures being garbage-collected too early when they were
	created in variable definitions.

2008-10-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Allow 'const nullary' symbols which can be
	matched, e.g., in 'case' expressions just like a real 'nullary'
	symbol. As discussed on the mailing list -- thanks to Max
	<23.14069@gmail.com> and John Cowan for insisting. ;-)

2008-10-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Bugfixes in list slicing.

2008-10-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Bugfixes in error reporting of
	eval/evalcmd when an imported file does not exist.

	* examples/sample.purerc: Add sample .purerc to examples.

2008-10-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.12 release.

	* pure.cc (main): .purerc was read twice when running pure from
	HOME.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Moved definition of the quasiquote from
	examples/quasiquote.pure, as requested by John Cowan and Eddie
	Rucker.

	* examples/reflection.pure: Reflection example, shows the use of
	'evalcmd' to obtain information about the running program.

	* parser.yy: Cosmetic syntax change. Allow the lhs to be omitted
	in simple rules ('when', 'let' etc.) if it is just '_'.

	* runtime.cc: New evalcmd primitive for executing interactive
	interpreter commands.

2008-10-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* expr.hh, interpreter.cc/h et al: Lift limitation of temporary
	levels (was 0xff previously, is 32 bit now).

	* examples/quasiquote.pure: Lisp-like quasiquote example.

	* interpreter.cc/hh, runtime.cc/h, lib/: Experimental support for
	the special form 'quote' and evaluation of quoted expressions
	using 'eval'.

	* lexer.ll: Overhaul 'clear', 'dump' and 'show' command so that
	they take the same basic set of selection options and work in a
	consistent fashion (mostly).

2008-10-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.11 release.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* examples/trace.pure: Add an example showing how to trace
	function calls for debugging purposes.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Warn about external symbols
	which have already been used (but not defined).

	This would previously go unnoticed (unlike defining a function and
	then later redeclaring it as an external, which is treated as an
	error). Which was bad because it could cause surprising behaviour
	when a function was used (but not defined) before declaring it as
	an external. Now we at least warn the user about such situations,
	using a message like "warning: symbol 'xyz' shadows previous
	undefined use". We could also make this an error, but this seems a
	bit harsh, considering that the user might simply fix up the
	offending definition, without having to exit the interpreter. The
	proper way would be to just patch up all old uses of the symbol to
	refer to the new external function instead, but there's currently
	no way to do that. NB: Due to lazy compilation, it's actually
	possible to refer to an external before it is declared and get the
	correct behaviour, but only if the corresponding definition isn't
	used (and compiled) before the extern declaration. This might be
	considered a bug. ;-)

	* lexer.ll: Rename the -F option of the 'dump' command to -n. The
	former was too easily confused with the -f option.

	* pure.1.in: Fix some errors in examples, various other smaller
	updates and cosmetic changes.

	* parser.yy: Various cosmetic changes in the grammar.

	Arbitrary (not just simple) expressions are now permitted as
	guards in equations. This means that syntax like 'foo x = bar x if
	y when y = baz x end' is now recognized (previously the 'y when
	... end' term had to be enclosed in parentheses).

	Removed the old [x;...] list comprehension syntax which has been
	deprecated since Pure 0.7.

	There's now direct support for empty lists and tuples in the
	grammar, so that these are treated in the same way as empty
	matrices, rather than being defined as nullary symbols in the
	prelude.

2008-10-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.10 release.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

2008-10-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/matrices.pure, runtime.cc/h: Add matrix conjugate operation
	and functions to create (sub/super-) diagonal matrices.

2008-10-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* printer.cc (printx): Fix missing parens in if-then-else, when
	the branches are a low-precedence construct like 'with' or 'when'.

2008-10-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.9 release.

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Optimize the case of monotonous and contiguous
	list slices so that it works in linear time.

2008-09-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/strings.pure: Special-case definition of string
	slices. These return strings now. Also, the special case of
	monotonous and contiguous ranges is now implemented in terms of
	the substr function for efficiency.

	* README, INSTALL: Update docs with latest project hosting
	information after the move to Google Code.

2008-09-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.8 release.

	* test/test025.pure: matrix tests. NOTE: This test is expected to
	fail if Pure was built without GSL support.

	* test/test024.pure: catmap and stream tests.

2008-09-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* lib/matrices.pure, runtime.cc/h: Added missing
	complex->double/int matrix conversions. Thorough overhaul of
	matrix<->pointer conversions, which now provide a complete set of
	conversions from/to any reasonable C array representation,
	including float, complex float, short and byte arrays.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fix a bug in cat which broke catmap on
	strings. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2008-09-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.7 release.

	* examples/gauss.pure, examples/linalg.pure: Add some examples for
	doing matrix computations in Pure.

	* runtime.cc, lib/matrices.pure: Minor bugfixes.

2008-09-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/matrices.pure: Moved the matrix operations from
	primitives.pure to their own module.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added a bunch of new matrix operations. In
	particular, list operations like filter and map now work on
	matrices, too.

2008-09-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Implemented basic GSL matrix support, including support for
	symbolic matrices (which is independent from GSL, so these will
	also work when building the interpreter without GSL) and matrix
	comprehensions. Marshalling of matrices in the C interface is also
	implemented, so that you can interface to GSL matrix functions
	without much ado. This required many additions and changes to the
	parser, interpreter, compiler, runtime and the prelude; details
	can be found in the svn log (see r759 and r769ff.).

	Preliminary documentation is in the NEWS file for now (the manual
	still needs to be updated).

2008-09-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* printer.cc: Fix up precedence calculation so that it properly
	deals with the case of negative floating point zeros.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Moved the inf and nan constants to the end
	of the module so that double arithmetic is already defined when
	these definitions are processed. Simplified the definitions of
	infp and nanp. Corrected the definition of abs so that it always
	returns 0.0 for both IEEE 754 positive and negative zeros.

	* configure.ac: Add configury for GSL support. Also added basic
	GSL checks and setup to interpreter.cc, pure.cc and runtime.cc.

2008-09-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.6 release.

	* interpreter.cc: Speedups in pattern-matching code.

2008-09-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc, lib/math.pure: More bugfixes.

2008-09-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Add 'dump' command. This is similar to
	'show', but dumps definitions to a file (named '.pure' by default,
	which, if present, is loaded after .purerc during interactive
	startup). This provides a quick-and-dirty means to save an
	interactive session and have it restored later. (This is not
	perfect, though, as variable values containing special objects
	such as thunks and pointers can't be reconstructed, and 'using' or
	'extern' declarations are not recorded. For those you should use
	the .purerc file instead.)

	* runtime.cc (pure_create_interp): Add new command line options
	(see below).

	* pure.cc (main): Source interactive startup files (first
	$HOME/.purerc, then $PWD/.purerc).

	Add options --norc to not source the rc files and --noediting to
	suppress readline editing, as well as --noprelude (long form of
	-n), --help (long form of -h) and --version (like --help, but only
	print version information).

	Overhaul help message.

2008-09-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc (main): In interactive mode, print a warning if -n was
	not specified and the prelude wasn't found. Suggested by Rob
	Hubbard.

	* printer.cc (operator << (ostream& os, const pure_expr *x)):
	Experimental support for calling a user-defined __show__ function
	to override print representations of expressions at runtime.

	* configure.ac, runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): Add configure checks
	for POSIX/ISOC99 complex types. (Requires reconfigure.)

	* runtime.cc (pure_force): Fix a rather obscure segfault in the
	thunk implementation. See also test/test023.pure.

	* lexer.ll: Warn about used identifiers which are also interactive
	commands.

	* printer.cc: Changed <<...>> syntax for "external" objects such
	as closures, thunks and pointers to #<...> syntax pilfered from
	Scheme. This is less likely to be mistaken for a valid Pure
	expression.

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Renamed the interactive 'list' command to
	'show', as suggested by John Cowan. This hopefully puts an end to
	inadvertent execution of that command, since 'show' is no prelude
	function and is deemed less likely to be used as a function name
	by the programmer.

2008-09-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Added the normal order fixed point combinator,
	'fix'.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Overhaul of list operations in the prelude, so
	that they properly work with "thunked" lists (streams). Where
	possible, these operations have been redesigned to make them
	non-strict, while keeping them tail-recursive for the parts of a
	list which have already been evaluated.

	In particular, the cat and catmap operations now handle infinite
	streams of infinite streams, and hence list comprehensions can
	draw values from infinite streams as well.

	The 'list' function can be used to convert a (finite) stream to an
	ordinary list, forcing its evaluation. Conversely, the new
	'stream' function converts an ordinary list (tuple, string) to a
	stream.

	There are a few other related changes in the prelude:

	- The slicing operation (!!) is now implemented in a completely
	generic way which works with any container data structure which
	implements the indexing (!) operation. It also works properly if
	both operands are infinite streams.

	- Arithmetic sequences (..) now take an infinity (inf or -inf) as
	the second operand and will generate the appropriate stream in
	such cases.

	- The repeat and cycle functions have been rewritten to make them
	Haskell-compatible, i.e., they only take a single argument now and
	generate infinite streams. Haskell's iterate function is now also
	implemented. The previous versions of repeat and cycle, which take
	an additional integer parameter to denote the desired length of
	the result and return an ordinary (eager) list, are now available
	under the names repeatn and cyclen. (To make cyclen compatible
	with cycle, it now also returns a list if applied to a string, use
	strcat to convert the result back to a string if needed.)

2008-09-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc, symtable.cc/h, lib/prelude.pure:
	Added thunks (anonymous parameterless closures), represented using
	the new postfix operator '&' (see prelude.pure). As usual, these
	use "call by need", i.e., they will be evaluated (and the results
	memoized) automatically when the value of a thunk is needed during
	pattern-matching or when calling a C function.

2008-08-31  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added references (expression pointers).

2008-08-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/gpure.lang: Added syntax highlighting for gedit. Contributed
	by Eddie Rucker.

2008-08-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/system.pure: New definitions of fopen/popen and
	fclose/pclose, using sentries which take care of closing a file
	object automagically when it's garbage-collected.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Add interface to sentries (see below).

	* runtime.cc/h: Added sentries -- expression "guards" which are
	applied to the target expression when it is garbage-collected.
	Only sentries on applications and pointer objects are supported
	right now.

	* Makefile.in: Set LC_ALL=C, to work around failed math tests due
	to locale-related problems on some systems. Note: This requires a
	reconfigure.

	* lib/system.pure: Add setlocale function.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): Add NULL and LC_* constants.

	* lexer.ll: Add option -p to list only private/public symbols to
	the 'list' command.

2008-08-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/: Clean up the public namespace.

	* lexer.ll: Added limited support for unicode symbols. These can
	now be declared as operator or nullary symbols. (At present this
	is only guaranteed to work if your scripts are encoded in UTF-8.)

	* parser.yy, etc.: Symbols can now be declared 'private'. These
	aren't visible anywhere except in the module that declares them.

2008-08-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* test/test022.pure: Add macro test script.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Add optimization rules for ($) and (.) so that
	they are expanded at compile time if possible.

2008-08-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, interpreter.cc: Added macro substitution
	facility. Pure macros are meta functions executed at compile time,
	which are defined by any number of equations (rewriting rules)
	prefixed with the 'def' keyword, e.g.:

	def foo (bar x) = foo x+1;
	def foo x = x;

	Only simple, unconditional rules are supported by now, but these
	are quite powerful already, since, as shown above, the macro
	parameters can be arbitrary patterns and macro definitions can
	also be recursive.

	Pure macros are lexically scoped, i.e., symbols on the rhs of a
	macro definition can never refer to anything outside the macro
	definition. (These are also known as "hygienic" macros.)

	* configure.ac: Bump version number. (Needs reconfigure.)

2008-08-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.5 release.

	* lib/prelude.pure: do operations now implemented with $$.

	* test/test020.pure, test/test021.pure: Cosmetic changes, added
	math.pure tests for checking exact/inexact/symbolic results.

	NOTE: test020.log is fairly big and thus still needs to be
	reviewed more thoroughly. If you can provide a helping hand there
	by checking at least some of the tested operations and post
	suspicious results to the mailing list, it will be much
	appreciated. :-)

	* lib/math.pure: Fixed the broken definition of the complex sqrt,
	and did some cosmetic surgery on some operations, to make them
	more compatible with established standards (IEEE 754, POSIX). This
	probably isn't perfect yet, so please report any suspicious
	results or glitches in branch cuts and the like.

	I also checked some of the complex trig and hyperbolic operations
	manually against my HP-50G calculator (whose numeric algorithms
	are based on earlier HP calculator software designed by William
	Kahan, the architect of IEEE 754), and they seem to provide the
	proper branch cuts now, so that results are identical with the
	calculator up to rounding discrepancies.

	Note that operations will now return complex results only if
	invoked with complex (or mixed complex/real) arguments, as
	suggested by Eddie Rucker. I also added the necessary type guards
	to ensure that operations are irreducible when invoked with
	non-numeric arguments.

2008-08-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* test/test020.pure: Added math.pure tests by Eddie Rucker.

	* runtime.cc (same): Bugfix in comparison of global functions.
	Handle the case of of an external which may chain to a Pure
	definition of the same global. In that case we may safely assume
	that the functions are the same anyway if they are represented by
	the same global symbol.

2008-08-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (subst): Defer const substitutions (and
	propagation of type tags) until all variable bindings have been
	processed, to prevent name capture in const substitutions.
	Reported by Eddie Rucker.

	* test/test019.pure: Regression test for the above.

2008-08-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* expr.cc (env::operator=): Bugfix: Only set temporary level of a
	constant or free variable if it wasn't defined previously at a
	lower level.

2008-08-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, printer.cc, etc.: Renamed the 'def' keyword
	to 'const', as originally proposed by Eddie Rucker. ('def' is
	still a reserved keyword, since it's soon going to be used for
	macro definitions.) Scripts and syntax highlighting files in the
	distribution have been updated accordingly.

2008-08-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Generate tail-recursive code for
	sequence operator.

	* lib/prelude.pure, lib/primitives.pure: Definition of $$ sequence
	operator.

2008-08-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc, interpreter.cc/h, runtime.cc: Overhaul of the script
	and library search algorithms.

	The prelude is now *always* searched for in PURELIB only, to
	prevent code injection issues. Thus to use a custom prelude you'll
	have to set the PURELIB environment variable accordingly, or
	employ the '-n' option and explicitly specify the prelude on the
	command line.

	Scripts specified on the command line or with the 'run' command
	will *only* be searched for in the current directory.

	In addition to the PURELIB environment variable, new -I/-L command
	line options and PURE_INCLUDE/PURE_LIBRARY environment variables
	are now available to specify additional directories to search for
	source files and dynamic libraries specified using relative
	pathnames in 'using' clauses.

	For source scripts opened with a 'using' clause, the interpreter
	searches the following directories in the given order:

	- the directory of the script containing the 'using' clause (or
	the current working directory if the 'using' clause is read from
	standard input),

	- directories specified with -I, in the order in which they are
	specified on the command line,

	- directories specified in colon-separated format in the
	PURE_INCLUDE variable, in the order in which they are specified,

	- the PURELIB directory.

	Similarly, dynamic libraries are searched for in:

	- the directory of the script containing the 'using' clause (or
	the current working directory if the 'using' clause is read from
	standard input),

	- directories specified with -L, in the order in which they are
	specified on the command line,

	- directories specified in colon-separated format in the
	PURE_LIBRARY variable, in the order in which they are specified,

	- the PURELIB directory,

	- other platform-specific locations searched by the dynamic
	linker, such as system library directories and LD_LIBRARY_PATH on
	Linux.

	Note that in either case the current working directory is *not*
	searched by default (unless the 'using' clause is read from
	standard input), but of course you can force this by adding '.' to
	the corresponding search path.

	* parser.yy, printer.cc et al: Revised list-of-tuples syntax. In
	order to include a tuple in a proper list value you can simply put
	the tuple inside parentheses now.

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll: Revised 'using' syntax so that script names
	are now separated with a comma. Updated library and sample scripts
	accordingly.

2008-08-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* pure.cc (main): More robust test for presence of the prelude.

	* interpreter.cc, lexer.ll: Implemented new script search
	algorithm, as discussed on the mailing list.

	Scripts loaded with a 'using' clause are now first searched in the
	directory of the script containing the 'using' clause, then in the
	PURELIB directory and finally in the current directory. This
	allows scripts to be installed in their own directory, along with
	any other non-library modules they need. Scripts specified on the
	command line or with the 'run' command are searched for in the
	current directory and then in the PURELIB directory, as before.

	Script names are now "canonicalized" by following symbolic links
	(albeit only one level) and removing '.' and '..' directory
	components in the absolute pathname. Also, checking whether a
	script has already been loaded now uses the canonicalized pathname
	so that, e.g., two scripts foo/baz.pure and bar/baz.pure are
	considered distinct modules and can both be used in the same
	program (unless they link to the same script file).

2008-08-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* test/test018.pure: Add test for integer marshalling.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): All C int parameter types now
	handle bigint arguments.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Moved basic rounding functions from
	math.pure, and fixed some minor glitches in the pow function.

2008-08-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added routines to convert signed integers
	to the corresponding unsigned quantities, as discussed on the
	mailing list.

	* lib/math.pure: Bugfixes, overhaul of number predicates, added
	missing semantic number predicates.

	* runtime.cc (pure_bigintval, same): Fix up bigint conversions and
	syntactic comparisons of doubles for the inf/nan cases.

	* lib/primitives.pure, runtime.cc/h: Removed obsolete fun and arg
	functions, as 'arg' conflicted with math.pure. Also, applp is now
	implemented directly in Pure, and the corresponding runtime
	routine has been removed as well.

2008-08-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern, named_type, type_name): Add
	support for single precision 'float' arguments and return values
	to the C interface. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

	* examples/signal.pure: Add signal processing example.

	* runtime.cc (pure_catch, pure_invoke): Collecting temporary
	values after an exception doesn't seem to be safe while an
	evaluation is still in progress. Moved this to doeval/dodefn in
	interpreter.cc where we're back at the toplevel and it is safe to
	do this.

2008-08-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/system.pure: Add 'trap' operation to configure
	signal handlers.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): Add signal constants.

	* pure.cc (main): Set up handlers for standard POSIX termination
	signals, mapping these to orderly Pure exceptions of the form
	'signal SIG'.

	* interpreter.cc (builtin_codegen), runtime.cc(bigint_div,
	bigint_mod): Handle division by zero by throwing a 'signal SIGFPE'
	exception. Previously, these would just bail out with an unhandled
	SIGFPE signal.

	* lexer.ll: Fixed a bug in option parsing of the 'list' command
	which would cause an option string starting with '-a' to be
	interpreted as an ordinary argument.

	* runtime.cc (pure_catch, pure_sys_vars): Fixed memory leaks.

2008-08-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_catch): Fix wrong stack cleanup, causing
	segfaults with catch/throw. Reported by Libor Spacek.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Additional configury for proper
	handling of dynamic linking on OSX (-install_name option,
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH). Reported by Ryan Schmidt. NOTE: This change
	requires a reconfigure.

2008-08-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (doeval, dodefn): Optimize the case of toplevel
	evaluations and variable definitions of constant expressions.

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Fixed memory leak caused by the new
	list and tuple code. Reported by Jiri Spitz. We now also impose a
	minimum size for speeding up the generated code for smaller list
	and tuple sizes.

2008-08-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Overhaul environment-handling code in the code
	generator so that it properly handles nested 'with' environments.

2008-07-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* w3centities.c: Updated to latest from W3C.

2008-07-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Streamline code for list and tuple
	expressions. This works around some severe performance bugs in the
	LLVM JIT, which gets awfully slow on deep call graphs.

	* interpreter.cc (run): LLVM 2.3 requires that we add the default
	shared library extension manually.

2008-07-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/h: Apply Rooslan S. Khayrov's patches to make the
	interpreter compile with LLVM 2.3.

	Note that this means that Pure really needs LLVM 2.3 now. By
	reverting these changes you can still make it work with LLVM 2.2,
	but we really recommend using LLVM 2.3 now since it has many
	improvements and bugfixes.

2008-07-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/math.pure: Add random number generator
	(Mersenne twister). Suggested by Jiri Spitz.

	* examples/avltree.pure: Added to examples.

	* lib/math.pure: Moved abs, sgn, min, max, pred and succ from
	math.pure to primitives.pure, so that they are included in the
	prelude. Make x%0 behave like x div 0 (which raises SIGFPE).

	* lib/: Jiri Spitz' port of the Q container types were added to
	the library (array.pure, dict.pure, heap.pure, set.pure).

2008-07-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/strings.pure: Make slicing work with strings.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fixed a bug in init function. Reported by
	Libor Spacek.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/system.pure: Added strftime function.

	* printer.cc: Add missing parens around low-precedence elements in
	proper lists. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

2008-07-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Added new "mapsto" constructor. Requested by
	Jiri Spitz.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): Turn system constants into real
	constant definitions.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/system.pure: Added a few time functions to the
	system interface.

2008-07-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (run): Temporarily suppress verbose output for
	using clause. This also makes the some of the test logs much
	smaller. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

2008-07-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/math.pure: Added rational numbers.

2008-07-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure, runtime.cc/h: Add the GMP gcd and lcm
	functions.

	* lexer.ll: 'list' command now also prints fixity and nullary
	declarations of listed symbols.

	* lib/math.pure: Added various bits and pieces, most notably the
	complex numbers. Also moved sqrt function from primitives.pure to
	math.pure.

2008-06-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Fix a segfault in external
	wrapper routines, due to the shadow stack not being popped when
	an external fails and thus the default rule gets used.

2008-06-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure.xml: Improved syntax highlighting for Kate. Fixed up
	highlighting of quoted string chars, as suggested by Eddie Rucker.
	Also added folding support for comments and block structure
	(case/with/when ... end).

	* lib/math.pure: Started module with math operations (exp, ln,
	trigonometric functions, etc.).

2008-06-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Promote type tags and substitute constants on
	the rhs of variable and constant definitions.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Using xs!ns for slicing conflicts with more
	general indexing of containers with arbitrary keys. Use !! for
	slicing instead. Restrict the definition to lists and tuples, and
	simplify it by using a list comprehension. Suggested by Jiri
	Spitz.

2008-06-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/h: Added pure_current_interp(), variable and constant
	definitions, management of temporary definition levels.

	* pure.cc, interpreter.cc, lexer.ll: Fix up completion support,
	second attempt (constructor symbols without any rules were
	still missing).

2008-06-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Fix up list command to properly deal with the new
	constant symbol category. -c now lists constant symbols, the
	previous -c option (print matching automata) was renamed to -a.

	* interpreter.cc et al: Implement constant definitions, as
	discussed on the mailing list. These work like variable
	definitions (using the new 'def' keyword in lieu of 'let'), but
	constants cannot be redefined (unless you first clear an existing
	definition), and constant values are directly substituted into the
	right-hand sides of equations rather than being evaluated at
	runtime.

2008-06-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/sort.c: Add another example for the runtime API.
	This one shows how to implement a C function in a module to be
	loaded by the Pure interpreter, which in turn calls other C and
	Pure functions.

2008-06-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Bugfix: include external symbols in command
	completion.

	* examples/poor.c: Add an example for the new public runtime API.
	Shows how to interface to the Pure interpreter in a standalone C
	application.

	* interpreter.cc/h, runtime.cc/h, lib/strings.pure: Add error
	reporting to the eval() routine.

	* interpreter.cc: Bugfix to make recursive source file parses work
	inside eval().

	* runtime.h, runtime.cc: Refactored the runtime library to provide
	a semantically complete public API for module writers.

	These operations are meant to be used by client modules or
	standalone applications which need to create their own Pure
	interpreters and/or require direct access to Pure expression
	data. See the PUBLIC API section in runtime.h for details. Modules
	created with this API must be linked against the runtime library
	(libpure.so).

2008-06-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.h, runtime.cc: Make pure_invoke() callable from C.

2008-06-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* expr.cc, interpreter.cc, parser.yy, lexer.ll, printer.cc:
	Implement Haskell-style "as" patterns. Also make sure that '_' on
	the lhs is always treated as the anonymous variable, even if it
	occurs as the head symbol in a function application.

2008-06-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in, etc/pure.vim, etc/pure.xml, etc/pure.lang:
	Cosmetic changes, all modes now highlight catch/throw.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fixed a glitch in the definition of foldr1
	which caused list elements to be processed in the wrong order.

2008-06-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.4 release.

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Fake interactive mode when we're not
	connected to a terminal but -i is specified. Thus sign-on message
	and command prompts will be printed as usual. This is needed, in
	particular, to make Emacs Pure-Eval mode work on Windows.

2008-06-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/symbolic.pure: Fix DNF example to accommodate changes
	in the operator system.

	* interpreter.cc (declare): Fix segfault in reporting of
	conflicting fixity declarations.

2008-06-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Add hash function to compute 32
	bit hash codes of Pure expressions. Suggested by Jiri Spitz.

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, interpreter.hh/cc: Add syntax for multiple
	left-hand sides in function definitions and 'case' rules, as
	requested by Jiri Spitz and discussed on the mailing list. See the
	manual page for details.

	* symtable.cc, lib/prelude.pure, lib/primitives.pure: Rename the
	bitwise operators '&' and '|' to 'and' and 'or'.

2008-06-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure.lang: New language definition file for Andre Simon's
	highlight program (http:/www.andre-simon.de/). This allows you to
	format Pure sources with syntax highlighting as HTML and LaTeX
	files, for instance.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Clean up the source tree. Moved
	auxiliary configure files and the syntax highlighting and
	programming mode stuff into separate config and etc
	subdirectories. Moreover, Makefile.in now has a target to
	regenerate the configury using autoconf and autoheader.

2008-06-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* matcher.hh: gcc 4.3 compatibility fixes. Suggested by Toni
	Graffy.

2008-06-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Various changes in order to facilitate script
	execution and interfacing to Emacs.

	Initial '#!' on a line now denotes a comment line, in order to
	support shebangs (see below).

	The new 'completion_matches' command provides information about
	completions to programs driving the interpreter, such as Emacs
	(see below).

	Paging of the 'list' command is now implemented using the program
	specified with the PURE_MORE environment variable. This allows you
	to disable this option (if PURE_MORE is undefined) or choose any
	pager program and options that you prefer. Define PURE_MORE=more
	in your shell startup files to get back the old behaviour of
	piping 'list' output through 'more'.

	* pure.cc: Added new -q (quiet) and -x (execute) options. The
	former is used in pure-mode.el to suppress the sign-on message of
	the interpreter. The latter can be used in conjunction with the
	new #! comment syntax to add shebangs to your script, see the
	manpage for details.

	* pure-mode.el.in: Added new Emacs Pure mode. This is a quick and
	dirty hack of Q mode and still needs some work (in particular,
	auto indentation is pretty much broken right now).

2008-06-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in, etc.: Overhauled configury and bumped
	the version number.

	Building a separate runtime lib on x86-64 works now (but requires
	a patched LLVM, see the INSTALL file for details). Linking the
	runtime lib on OSX should also work now. Moreover, it is now
	possible to install different Pure versions in parallel, again see
	the INSTALL file for details.

2008-06-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.3 release.

	* configure.ac, etc.: Added autoconf support. Various fixes for 64
	bit and Windows compatibility. See the INSTALL file for updated
	installation instructions.

2008-06-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile, interpreter.cc: Put the runtime and interpreter into a
	separate shared library, to make it possible for modules to link
	against the runtime, and to reduce the memory footprint when
	multiple instances of the interpreter are run as different
	processes. Also, this makes it possible to access the runtime
	routines on systems where a program cannot dlopen itself.

2008-05-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Optimization of pure_freenew calls.

	* lib/strings.pure: Make 'cycle' work on strings. Reported by
	Eddie Rucker.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Make 'index' work on lists. Code contributed
	by Eddie Rucker.

2008-05-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Rewrite prelude operations to make them
	tail-recursive.

	* interpreter.cc (toplevel_codegen): Experimental support for
	tail-recursive logical operators (&& and ||). This works but is
	disabled, since it makes these operations behave in different ways
	depending on the context, which is a really bad idea because it
	violates referential transparency.

2008-05-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Overhaul of the shadow stack
	machinery. Environment vectors are now maintained on the shadow
	stack, so that all local functions and anonymous closures are
	eligible for tail call optimization, even if they need access to
	their environment.

2008-05-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Add marshalling between long (64
	bit) ints and Pure bigints in the C interface. This means that
	both Pure ints and bigints can now be passed for 'long' arguments
	of externals (with sign extension/truncation as necessary), and
	'long' values are promoted to Pure bigints on return. Hence C
	functions taking 64 bit integers as arguments and returning them
	as results can now be called from Pure without loosing bits due to
	truncation.

	* interpreter.cc: Make toplevel if-then-else properly
	tail-recursive. Thus, e.g., the following function will now run in
	constant stack space: count x = if x<=0 then x else count (x-1);
	This also works with nested if-then-else constructs, as long as
	they form the right-hand side of an equation.

2008-05-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Fix more memory allocation bugs in
	exception handling.

	* runtime.cc, lib/system.pure: Bugfixes in the scanf
	functions. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

	* pure.cc, runtime.cc, util.cc: Windows/MinGW compatibility
	fixes. Suggested by Jiri Spitz.

2008-05-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Fix premature freeing of eval result, and a minor
	memory allocation glitch in the catch function. Reported by Eddie
	Rucker.

	* Makefile: Bump version number.

	* interpreter.cc: If there are any child environments, doeval and
	dodefn both create semi-permanent environments now, so that the
	child environments and the corresponding LLVM IR survive for the
	entire lifetime of any embedded closures, which might still be
	called at a later time. This fixes the segfaults occurring when a
	closure gets called after its associated environment was purged. A
	partial fix for some situations (as reported earlier by Chris
	Double) was already in the 0.2 release, but this didn't deal with
	all cases, such as closures constructed in a call to the eval
	function, as reported by Eddie Rucker.

2008-05-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Major overhaul of expression memory
	handling. Fixed the shadow stack and memory debugging code. Both
	function arguments and environment are now visible on the shadow
	stack, and all remaining memory leaks have been fixed. Note that,
	compared to previous revisions, the shadow stack slows down
	compiled code by some 10% and it needs some additional memory.
	OTOH, it also provides additional data that will be needed in the
	planned symbolic debugger, and it seems to be the most efficient
	way to handle dangling expression pointers after an exception
	anyway.

2008-05-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_free_internal): Fixed a glitch which was
	causing big memleaks. Reported by Libor Spacek.

	* interpreter.cc (define): Fixed error messages.
	
	* interpreter.cc, runtime.h: Reorganize pure_expr data structure
	so that the data fields are *always* aligned on 8 byte boundaries.
	This should now also work on 32 bit architectures where doubles
	are aligned on 8 byte boundaries, such as Linux on 32 bit PPC.
	Reported by Tim Haynes.

	* interpreter.cc: Fixed some case labels in switch instructions
	which should be signed rather than unsigned values. Also made
	void* a pointer to a dummy struct in LLVM IR, so that it can be
	distinguished from all other pointer types, and added support for
	short (16 bit) and long (64 bit) integer types (as well as the
	corresponding pointer types) in the C interface.

	Please note that the typename 'long' *always* denotes signed 64
	bit integers in Pure's extern declarations, even if the C 'long'
	type is actually 32 bit (as it usually is even on most 64 bit
	systems).

2008-05-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.h: Fix compilation problems when header gets included
	from C.

2008-05-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* funcall.h: Reduce maximum number of function parameters to
	64. This seems to be large enough for most purposes, and speeds up
	compilation with -Ox by a factor of around 10.

	* Makefile: Overhaul of build options. In particular, the
	'default' build now includes basic optimization (-O) which makes
	the interpreter almost as fast as with the 'release' build, and
	produces a working interpreter also on 64 bit systems. (The
	'debug' build is still broken there, but see the SYSTEM NOTES
	section in the INSTALL file for a workaround.)

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: 64 bit compatibility fixes in bigint
	handling.

2008-05-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Fix a severe bug in the environment handling
	code of the code generator, which could cause failed assertions in
	the code generator, or wrong code to be generated in some cases.
	To resolve this issue, the code generator now properly keeps
	separate environments for each rule of a function
	definition. Reported by John Lunney.

	* Makefile: Redirect warning and error messages from regression
	tests to the logfile.

2008-05-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (uminop): Handle the value -0x80000000 at the
	border of the int range, so that it is correctly treated as a
	machine int.

2008-05-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, printer.cc, etc.: Change the "G" suffix to denote
	bigints to "L" ("G" can too easily be mistaken for a digit; also,
	Python uses the same "L" notation for bigints). Reported by Eddie
	Rucker.

2008-05-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Made the pow function work with all
	combinations of integer and double arguments. Also added the sqrt
	function and the ^ operator.

	* runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Added predicates funp, lambdap,
	varp checking for named and anonymous closures and unbound global
	variables, respectively. Requested by Libor Spacek.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern, fun_prolog): Handle some obscure
	cases of name collisions between Pure and C functions.

2008-05-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* INSTALL: Add system-specific notes.

	* Makefile: Massaged some rules for OSX compatibility. In
	particular, -rdynamic is now in the LDFLAGS, so that it can be
	removed more easily, and I also removed the install -s flag so
	that the pure executable is installed without stripping the
	symbols which are needed to properly resolve runtime externals on
	OSX. Reported by Ryan Schmidt and others.

	* matcher.cc (merge_ctrans): Fixed broken mpz_cmp() test causing
	transitions on different (instead of equal) bigint constants to be
	merged. Reported by Libor Spacek.

2008-05-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.2 release.

	* lexer.ll, printer.cc: Add an explicit notation for big
	integers. Any integer immediately followed by the uppercase letter
	"G" (as in "biG" or "GMP") will now always be interpreted as a
	bigint constant, even if it fits into a machine integer. This
	notation is also used when printing bigint constants. This change
	was necessary to make it possible to write rules matching against
	"small bigint" constants.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added operations to recognize function
	applications and extract the function and argument parts,
	implemented in runtime.cc. Note that these operations can't be
	defined in Pure because of the "head is function" rule which means
	that in a pattern of the form f x, f is always a literal function
	symbol and not a variable.

2008-05-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* README: Moved installation instructions to a separate INSTALL
	file, added Eddie Rucker's detailed instructions there.

	* util.cc (myiconv): Apple's iconv takes const char** as 2nd
	parameter. #ifdef that case. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Fixed a bug in the generated
	wrapper code for external calls, which caused function arguments
	to be garbage-collected prematurely, when they were still needed
	to create the default value, in the case of external calls
	returning a null expression pointer to indicate failure. Reported
	by Eddie Rucker.

	* test/test4.pure: Disabled tail call checks, as they may fail on
	some platforms. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* test/test1.pure: Corrected fact3 example, added test cases.
	Reported by Libor Spacek.

2008-05-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile: Overhaul of regression tests so that results of
	expressions are recorded. Also, 'make check' doesn't depend on the
	log files any more, so that the logs can be stored in svn. You can
	now use the explicit goal 'make logs' to regenerate the logs for
	changed test files.

	* runtime.cc (same): Added a syntactic equality test. Requested by
	Eddie Rucker.

	* Makefile: Add $(LDFLAGS) and $(LIBS) to the link line, so that
	the user can easily add his own linker options and local
	libraries.

	* lib/strings.pure: Add missing range check in string indexing
	operation. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

	* printer.cc (operator <<): Handle stack overflow while printing
	an expression.

	* interpreter.cc (dodefn): Fix a tricky bug causing the executable
	code of closures bound to variables to be freed when it was still
	needed. Reported by Chris Double.

2008-05-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Proper alignment of value fields in expression
	struct on 64 bit systems. Reported by Tim Haynes.

	* Makefile: g++ shouldn't be hardcoded, use $(CXX) instead.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): More OSX compatibility fixes.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

2008-04-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Fix a compilation error (STL bug:
	http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11729) as well as some
	bogus warnings with Apple gcc 4.0.1. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* Makefile (make depend): Get rid of bogus LLVM dependencies.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* lexer.ll, parser.yy: Fixes for compatibility with newer flex and
	bison versions. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2008-04-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.1 release.

2008-04-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/symbolic.pure: Add symbolic evaluation example. This is
	just a straightforward port of some Q examples.
