;;; pure-mode.el --- as simple Pure mode -*- Emacs-Lisp -*-

;; Author/Maintainer: Albert Graef <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

;; Distributed under GPL V3 (or later; see the accompanying COPYING file).

;; INSTALLATION: If necessary, edit the values of the `pure-prog' and
;; `pure-libdir' variables below. This usually isn't necessary if the PURELIB
;; environment variable is set.

(defvar pure-prog "@bindir@/pure")
(defvar pure-libdir "@libdir@/pure")

;; Then copy this file to your site-lisp directory. In addition, to make Pure
;; mode available and enable it for *.pure and *.purerc files, you'll have to
;; add the following to your emacs startup file:

;; (require 'pure-mode)
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;;       (cons '("\\.pure\\(rc\\)?$" . pure-mode) auto-mode-alist))

;; Furthermore, you can enable font lock (syntax highlighting) as follows:

;; (add-hook 'pure-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)
;; (add-hook 'pure-eval-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)

;; Pure mode has support for code folding using the hideshow minor mode. To
;; enable this, load hideshow before Pure mode in your .emacs:

;; (require 'hideshow)

;; You can then invoke hideshow manually using M-x hs-minor-mode. To have
;; hs-minor-mode enabled in all your Pure mode buffers, add the following to
;; your .emacs:

;; (add-hook 'pure-mode-hook 'hs-minor-mode)

;; Using the Pure-Eval hook you can also rebind the cursor up and down keys to
;; the history cycling commands:

;; (add-hook 'pure-eval-mode-hook
;;	   (lambda ()
;;	     (define-key pure-eval-mode-map [up] 'comint-previous-input)
;;	     (define-key pure-eval-mode-map [down] 'comint-next-input)))

;; Finally, you might wish to add some global key bindings, such as:

;; (global-set-key "\C-c\M-p" 'run-pure)
;; (global-set-key "\C-x\M-p" 'pure-scratchpad)

;; Note that Pure and Pure-Eval mode provide these bindings anyway and the
;; commands are also available from the Pure menu, but the global bindings
;; above may be convenient to enter Pure or Pure-Eval mode from other buffers.
;; This is useful, in particular, if Emacs is invoked without a Pure script.

;; The run-pure command invokes the Pure interpreter without a script in a
;; comint buffer named *pure-eval*. Another method to invoke the interpreter
;; is to open a script file and use the command pure-run-script (C-c C-k in
;; Pure mode).

;; The pure-scratchpad command opens a scratch buffer named *pure-scratch* and
;; puts it in Pure mode. This buffer can be used like any other Pure mode
;; buffer but isn't associated with a file (similar to the Emacs Lisp buffer
;; *scratch*). Thus you can't "run" the *pure-scratch* buffer with C-c C-k
;; (unless you save it to a file first), but you can use it to feed Pure code
;; into a running interpreter instance with the pure-send-line (C-c C-c) and
;; pure-send-region (C-c C-r) commands.

;; Another useful command to always remember is the pure-help command (C-c h
;; in Pure and Pure-Eval mode) which lets you read the online manual inside
;; emacs if emacs-w3m is installed (see below). Always use this command
;; instead of the Pure interpreter's 'help' command. (The latter will try to
;; run the command line version of w3m which doesn't work all that well in an
;; Emacs buffer.)

;; The online help facility uses emacs-w3m to display help files in html
;; format, if it is installed and loaded. To these ends, put the following
;; line into your .emacs (make sure that this comes before Pure mode):

;; (require 'w3m-load)

;; Otherwise Emacs' generic browse-url function will be used, which usually
;; invokes some external browser by default.

Provides syntax highlighting (using `font-lock-mode') and
automatic indentation of Pure code, completion of Pure symbols
and integrated help, etags support, as well as facilities to run
scripts and evaluate code with the Pure interpreter.

The major operations of this mode are also accessible from the
menu bar (Pure menu).

Completion and Help
-------------------

\\<pure-mode-map>\\[pure-complete-symbol] completes the symbol at point, looking up known Pure
symbols in the online documentation index.

\\[pure-help] invokes the online help. You can optionally specify a
Pure symbol or topic to look up in the index.

Etags Support
-------------

Use the `pure-make-tags' (\\[pure-make-tags]) command to create an Emacs
TAGS file for the script in the current buffer or a given
collection of scripts (shell glob patterns are permitted).
You can then employ the usual Emacs commands such as
`find-tag' \(\\[find-tag]) to locate the definitions of Pure symbols
in the given scripts (and all their imports). See info node
`(emacs)Tags' for details.

Indentation and Filling
-----------------------

Two distinct basic indentation styles are provided: ``hanging
indent'' which indents right-hand sides of equations so that they
are aligned at `=' symbols (this is the default), and ``block
indent'' which does normal block indentation of equations. The
default indentation style can be set with the `pure-indent-equals'
variable (see below) and also changed quickly in a buffer-local
fashion with the `pure-toggle-indent-mode' command.

\\[pure-electric-tab] indents the current line. \\[pure-indent-line-or-region] indents an entire region
of Pure code (if the region is currently active, otherwise it
indents the current line). Other electric characters such as `;'
and `=' also perform automatic indentation, see below.

\\[pure-electric-tab] takes into account the surrounding context. When inside
a comment, it uses relative indentation (see `indent-relative').
When inside a string, it just inserts a literal tab character.

\\[fill-paragraph] fills paragraphs in comments and strings. You can also use
this command with a prefix argument to justify the text between
margins. (Please note that at present this command doesn't deal
with escaped newlines, thus you'll have to add those manually
when using this command with Pure strings.)

Some important variables controlling indentation/edit style:

`pure-block-indent': Indentation of Pure code with respect to
    containing block. Default: 2.

`pure-extra-indent': Extra indentation for Pure code blocks at
    the beginning of a line. Default: 0.

`pure-tab-always-indent': Non-nil means \\[pure-electric-tab] should always
    reindent the current line, regardless of where in the line
    point is when the \\[pure-electric-tab] command is used. Default: t.

`pure-electric-keys': Non-nil means that keys like `=', `;', `(',
    `)' etc. do automatic indentation and alignment. Note that if
    this is nil then `pure-align-equals' doesn't have any effect
    either. Default: t.

`pure-indent-equals': Non-nil means that the right-hand sides of
    equations are indented so that they are aligned at `='
    symbols (``hanging indent''). Otherwise normal block
    indentation of equations is done instead. Default: t.

`pure-align-equals': Non-nil means that `=' at the end of a line
    is aligned with a previous equation at the same block level.
    Note: This setting is independent of `pure-indent-equals'.
    Default: t.

There are key bindings for quickly changing the indentation
modes on a per-buffer basis (see the command list below), and the
current status of the `pure-electric-keys', `pure-indent-equals'
and `pure-align-equals' flags is displayed in the mode line
\(`aei' indicators).

Other Editing Commands
----------------------

Emacs provides some movement and editing commands which deal with
balanced parentheses, see info node `(emacs)Parentheses' for
details. These are also quite handy when editing expressions in
Pure mode.

Like other programming language modes, Pure mode also offers some
special commands which operate on ``defuns'', i.e., toplevel
items in Pure: definitions, declarations and expressions. (In the
following, we call these just ``definitions''.)

The following commands traverse the tree of blocks and
definitions in a Pure script. They provide a quick way to
navigate the block hierarchy of a Pure program. Each of these
commands also accepts a repeat count as a prefix arg. (Please
note that the alternative shifted cursor key bindings are only
available if you're running a GUI version of emacs.)

`pure-prev-defun' (\\[pure-prev-defun], <M-home>) moves backward to the
beginning of the previous definition at the same or a lower block
level.

`pure-next-defun' (\\[pure-next-defun], <M-end>) moves forward to the
beginning of the next definition at the same or a lower block
level.

`pure-backward-defun' (\\[pure-backward-defun], <M-prior>) moves backward to the
beginning of the previous definition at the same block level,
skipping over definitions in lower levels.

`pure-forward-defun' (\\[pure-forward-defun], <M-next>) moves forward to the
beginning of the next definition at the same block level,
skipping over definitions in lower levels.

Note that `pure-prev-defun' and `pure-next-defun' can be used to
visit all definitions in a script, traversing the block structure
in preorder or postorder, respectively. In contrast,
`pure-backward-defun' and `pure-forward-defun' skip over any
local blocks of definitions contained in the current block
\(pretty much like `backward-sexp' and `forward-sexp' do for
balanced parentheses), so they can be used to move in larger
increments.

These commands always stop when reaching the beginning or end of
the current block, respectively.  However, you can then repeat
the command to move on to outer block levels.

*Note:* Only the first definition on each line (or behind the
beginning of each block) will be located by these commands, so it
is generally a good idea to start each definition on a line of
its own. Also, try to avoid definitions looking like line
noise (punctuation only), as these cannot be recognized in the
current implementation.

There's also a command to mark a Pure definition, which is handy
if you want to operate on an entire definition.

`pure-mark-defun' (\\[pure-mark-defun]) marks the current definition around
point. It puts the mark at the end of the definition and point at
its beginning.

Folding
-------

Pure mode has support for code folding using the hideshow minor
mode, which usually comes with Emacs. To enable this, load
hideshow before Pure mode in your .emacs:

  (require 'hideshow)

This makes sure that Pure's block and comment syntax are known to
hideshow. You can then invoke hideshow manually using
\\[hs-minor-mode]. To have hideshow enabled in all your Pure mode
buffers, add the following to your .emacs:

  (add-hook 'pure-mode-hook 'hs-minor-mode)

See `hs-minor-mode' for details on how to use this mode.

Running the Pure Interpreter
----------------------------

Pure mode also provides tight integration with the Pure
interpreter. First, the interpreter can be started in a
buffer (see `pure-eval-mode') using \\[run-pure]. Second, the
`pure-run-script' (\\[pure-run-script]) command lets you run the
interpreter on the script in the current buffer. It will be
verified that the buffer has a file associated with it, and you
will be prompted to save edited buffers when invoking this
command.

Third, you can also feed lines, definitions or arbitrary regions
of Pure code into a running interpreter with the
`pure-send-line' (\\[pure-send-line]), `pure-send-defun' (\\[pure-send-defun]),
`pure-send-region' (\\[pure-send-region]) and `pure-send-yank' (\\[pure-send-yank])
commands. (This starts a new interpreter instance without a
script if necessary.)

If `pure-send-skip-prompts' is set (the default), the send
commands will recognize transcripts of an interactive session
which contain both command lines starting with a prompt and
results printed by the interpreter. In this case the command
prompts are removed and all lines not starting with a command
prompt are skipped, which is convenient, in particular, to send
examples from the online documentation which show sample
interpreter interactions.

When working with these commands, it is often convenient to have
a scratchpad for entering Pure definitions and expressions; this
is provided by the `pure-scratchpad' (\\[pure-scratchpad]) command which
creates a *pure-scratch* buffer very much like the standard
*scratch* buffer but operated in Pure mode.

The `pure-eval' (\\[pure-eval]) command evaluates a Pure expression
read from the minibuffer and prints its result in the echo area,
or, if invoked with a prefix arg, inserts the result into the
current buffer.

`pure-clear' (\\[pure-clear]) clears the definition of a Pure symbol using
the interpreter's `clear' command. Similarly, `pure-show' (\\[pure-show])
shows the definition of a Pure symbol, using the `show' command
of the interpreter. This command can also be invoked with a
prefix arg to insert the output of `show' into the current buffer.

`pure-break' (\\[pure-break]) and `pure-trace' (\\[pure-trace]) set (or, if
invoked with a prefix arg, delete) debugger breakpoints and
tracepoints. (You may first have to enable debugging mode with
`pure-toggle-debug-mode' (\\[pure-toggle-debug-mode]) when using these.)

Other special commands are provided to quickly locate the main
script and the input line of the pure-eval buffer, and to visit
the source lines shown in error messages. These are the same as
in `pure-eval-mode' (which see).

Customization
-------------

The mode can be customized with the Customize menu option which
is a shortcut for \\[customize-group] pure.

Entry to this mode calls the value of `pure-mode-hook' if that
value is non-nil.

  "Major mode for interacting with the Pure interpreter.

This is a major mode based on `comint-mode' which lets you run
the Pure interpreter in an emacs buffer. It also provides tight
integration with `pure-mode' so that you can run Pure scripts or
feed script lines into the interpreter.

The `pure-current-msg-or-send' (\\<pure-eval-mode-map>\\[pure-current-msg-or-send]) command
uses `comint-send-input' to submit a command line to the
interpreter (or to copy it to the command prompt when point is
not at the current command line). If point is at an error message
describing a source reference, the command visits the given line
in the corresponding source file in another window instead.

Error messages are indicated with a special font. Pressing the
middle mouse button (button2) over such a message visits the
corresponding source line in another window (`pure-mouse-msg'
command).

The following commands can be used to scan through error messages
found in the buffer:

`pure-first-msg' (\\[pure-first-msg])
`pure-next-msg' (\\[pure-next-msg])
`pure-prev-msg' (\\[pure-prev-msg])
`pure-last-msg' (\\[pure-last-msg])

The following commands let you visit the script that is currently
running and quickly go to the prompt at the current input line in
the pure-eval buffer:

`pure-find-script' (\\[pure-find-script])
`pure-goto-input-line' (\\[pure-goto-input-line])

\(The above commands are also provided in `pure-mode'. If you like,
you can bind them globally, so that you can invoke them from
other kinds of buffers as well.)

Besides this, you can use the usual comint commands, see the
description of `comint-mode' for details. Some important commands
are listed below:

\\[comint-previous-input] and \\[comint-next-input] cycle through the command history.
\\[comint-previous-matching-input] and \\[comint-next-matching-input] search the command history.
\\[comint-interrupt-subjob] sends a Ctl-C to the interpreter.
\\[comint-send-eof] sends a Ctl-D to the interpreter.
\\[comint-dynamic-list-input-ring] lists the command history.
\\[completion-at-point] performs symbol and filename completion.

Note that in difference to standard comint mode, the C-a/Home
keys are rebound to `comint-bol', to mimic the behaviour of the
default binding of these keys in the interpreter.

Most of these operations can also be selected from the Comint and
Pure menus accessible from the menu bar. The interpreter's prompt
and lines containing error messages are described by the
variables `pure-prompt-regexp' and `pure-msg-regexp'. (Note that
if you have set the PURE_PS environment variable then you'll have
to modify `pure-prompt-regexp' accordingly.) The history file and
size is given by the `pure-histfile' and `pure-histsize'
variables.

The mode can be customized with the Customize menu option which
is a shortcut for \\[customize-group] pure.

Entry to this mode runs the hooks on `comint-mode-hook' and
`pure-eval-mode-hook' (in that order).
