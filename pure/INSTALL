INSTALLING PURE (AND LLVM)
========== ==== ==== =====

These instructions (mostly by courtesy of Eddie Rucker, thanks Eddie!) explain
how to compile and install LLVM (which is the compiler backend required by
Pure) and the Pure interpreter itself. The instructions are somewhat biased
towards Linux and other Unix-like systems; the SYSTEM NOTES section at the end
of this file details the tweaks necessary to make Pure compile and run on
various other platforms. More information about installing LLVM and the
required LLVM source packages can be found at http://llvm.org.

Pure is known to work on Linux, Mac OSX and MS Windows, and should compile
(with the usual amount of tweaking) on all recent UNIX/POSIX-based platforms.
We recommend using version 4.x of the GNU C++ compiler; it should be available
almost everywhere (in fact, since you'll need LLVM anyway, you can also use
the gcc frontend available for LLVM). You'll also need a Bourne-compatible
shell and GNU make, which are also readily available on most platforms.

A binary package in msi format is provided for Windows users in the download
area of the pure-lang.sf.net project page. Ports and packages for other
systems are also available; see the SYSTEM NOTES section below for details.


BASIC INSTALLATION
===== ============

The basic installation process is as follows. Note that steps 1-3 are only
required once. Steps 2-3 can be avoided if binary LLVM packages are available
for your system. Additional instructions for compiling Pure from SVN sources
can be found in the INSTALLING FROM SVN SOURCES section below. Moreover, you
can refer to the OTHER BUILD AND INSTALLATION OPTIONS section below for
details about various options available when building and installing Pure.

STEP 1. Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed (-dev
denotes corresponding development packages):

- GNU make, GNU C/C++ and the corresponding libraries;

- flex and bison (these are only required when compiling the Pure SVN sources,
  see the INSTALLING FROM SVN SOURCES section below);

- the GNU multiprecision library (libgmp, -dev);

- the GNU scientific library (libgsl, -dev; this isn't a strict requirement,
but you certainly want to have this library in order to make GSL matrices work
in Pure);

- the GNU readline library (libreadline, -dev);

- the GNU ltdl library (libltdl, -dev; only required for building LLVM);

- subversion (this is only needed to fetch the SVN sources, see below).

E.g., the required packages for Ubuntu are: make, g++, g++ 4.0 multilib, flex,
bison, libgmp3c2, libgmp3-dev, libgsl0, libgsl0-dev, readline5-dev, libltdl3,
libldtl3-dev, subversion.

All dependencies are available as free software. Here are some links if you
need or want to install the dependencies from source:

- GNU C/C++: http://gcc.gnu.org

- GNU make: http://www.gnu.org/software/make

- Flex: http://flex.sourceforge.net

- Bison: http://www.gnu.org/software/bison

- GMP: http://www.gnu.org/software/gmp

- GSL: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

- GNU readline: http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html

- GNU ltdl (part of the libtool software): http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool

Subversion is available from http://subversion.tigris.org. There's also a very
nice Windows frontend, TortoiseSVN, see http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org.

STEP 2. Get and unpack the LLVM 2.3 sources at:
http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#2.3

STEP 3. Configure, build and install LLVM as follows:

$ cd llvm-2.3
$ ./configure --enable-optimized --disable-assertions --disable-expensive-checks --enable-targets=host-only
$ make
$ sudo make install

IMPORTANT: On x86-64 systems you also have to add --enable-pic. See the
comments on 64 bit support in the SYSTEM NOTES section below.

Note that the configure flags are for an optimized (non-debug) build and
disable all compilation targets but the one for your system. You might wish to
omit --enable-targets=host-only if you want to enable cross-compilation (this
isn't supported by Pure right now, but other LLVM applications offer such
capabilities). To do a debug build of LLVM, simply leave away all the extra
configure parameters (except possibly --enable-targets=host-only). Note,
however, that this will have an impact on the speed of the Pure compiler.

STEP 4. Get and unpack the Pure sources at: http://pure-lang.sf.net/

The latest release tarballs can always be found on the SourceForge project
page. See "Downloads" on the Pure website for a quick link to the download
section.

STEP 5. Configure, build and install Pure as follows (x.y denotes the current
Pure version number, 0.7 at the time of this writing):

$ cd pure-x.y
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

The last command installs the pure program, the runtime.h header file, the
runtime library libpure.so and the library scripts under /usr/local; the
installation prefix can be changed with the --prefix configure option, see
OTHER BUILD AND INSTALLATION OPTIONS for details.

(The runtime.h header file is not needed for normal operation, but can be used
to write C/C++ extensions modules, if you need to access and manipulate Pure
expressions from C/C++.)

On some systems you have to tell the dynamic linker to update its cache so
that it finds the Pure runtime library. E.g., on Linux this is done as
follows:

$ sudo /sbin/ldconfig

After the build is complete, you can also run a few tests to check that Pure
is working correctly on your computer:

$ make check

If all is well, all tests should pass. If not, email the author or the Pure
mailing list for help. (Note that under MS Windows this step is expected to
fail on some math-related tests such as test020.pure which stress-test the
system's math routines, because some of these are broken in Microsoft's C
library.)

STEP 6. The Pure interpreter should be ready to go now.

Run Pure interactively as:

$ pure
Pure 0.7 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (c) 2008 by Albert Graef
This program is free software distributed under the GNU Public License
(GPL V3 or later). Please see the COPYING file for details.
Loaded prelude from /usr/local/lib/pure-0.7/prelude.pure.

Check that it works:

> 6*7;
42

Check that GSL support is available:

> show gsl_version
let gsl_version = "1.9";

(If this doesn't display anything then please review your installation process
and make sure that you have GSL installed. The configure program should show
that GSL support is available in the summary. You can run Pure without this,
but then the numeric GSL matrices won't be available.)

Read the online documentation (this invokes the Pure manual page):

> help

Exit the interpreter (you can also just type the end-of-file character at the
beginning of a line, i.e., Ctrl-D on Unix):

> quit


INSTALLING FROM SVN SOURCES
========== ==== === =======

The latest development version of Pure is available in its subversion (SVN)
source code repository. You can browse the repository at:

http://pure-lang.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pure-lang/

(See the pure/trunk subdirectory for the latest sources.)

Note that if you're going with the development sources, you'll also need
fairly recent versions of the flex and bison utilities (flex 2.5.31 and bison
2.3 should be ok).

To compile from the development sources, replace steps 4 and 5 above with:

STEP 4': Fetch the SVN sources.

$ svn co http://pure-lang.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pure-lang/pure/trunk pure

This will only fetch the latest development sources (the "trunk") from svn and
put it into the 'pure' subdirectory in the current directory. To check out the
entire tree, including past releases and other branches, into a subdirectory
named 'pure-lang', use the following command instead:

$ svn co http://pure-lang.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pure-lang pure-lang

This step needs to be done only once; once you've checked out your working
copy, you can update it to the latest revision at any time by running
'svn up'.

STEP 5': Configure, build and install Pure:

$ cd pure (or 'cd pure-lang/pure/trunk', if you checked out the entire tree)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install


OTHER BUILD AND INSTALLATION OPTIONS
===== ===== === ============ =======

The Pure configure script takes a few options which enable you to change the
installation path and control a number of other build options. Moreover, there
are some environment variables which also affect compilation and installation.

Use './configure --help' to print a summary of the provided options.

INSTALLATION PATH
------------ ----

By default, the pure program, the runtime.h header file, the runtime library
and the library scripts are installed in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/include,
/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/lib/pure, respectively. This can be changed by
specifying the desired installation prefix with the --prefix option, e.g.:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr

(Note that if you install Pure into a non-standard location, you may have to
set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or a similar variable so that the dynamic linker finds the
Pure runtime library, libpure.so.)

In addition, the DESTDIR variable enables package maintainers to install Pure
into a special "staging" directory, so that installed files can be packaged
more easily. If set at installation time, DESTDIR will be used as an
additional prefix to all installation paths. For instance, the following
command will put all installed files into the tmp-root subdirectory of the
current directory:

$ make install DESTDIR=tmp-root

Beginning with version 0.4, Pure fully supports parallel installations of
different versions of the interpreter without any further ado. To these ends,
bin/pure, include/pure, lib/libpure.so, lib/pure and man/man1/pure.1 are
actually symbolic links to the current version (bin/pure-x.y,
include/pure-x.y, lib/libpure-x.y.so etc., where x.y is the version
number). If you install a new version of the interpreter, the old version
remains available as pure-x.y.

SEPARATE BUILD DIRECTORY
-------- ----- ---------

It is possible to build Pure in a separate directory, in order to keep your
source tree tidy and clean, or to build multiple versions of the interpreter
with different compilation flags from the same source tree.

To these ends, just cd to the build directory and run configure and make
there, e.g. (this assumes that you start from the source directory):

$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD
$ ../configure
$ make

COMPILER AND LINKER OPTIONS
-------- --- ------ -------

There are a number of environment variables you can set on the 'configure'
command line if you need special compiler or linker options:

- CPPFLAGS: preprocessor options (-I, -D, etc.)
- CXXFLAGS: compilation options (-g, -O, etc.)
- LDFLAGS:  linker flags (-s, -L, etc.)
- LIBS:     additional objects and libraries (-lfoo, bar.o, etc.)

For instance, the following 'configure' command changes the default
compilation options to '-g' and adds '/opt/include' and '/opt/lib' to the
include and library search paths, respectively:

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/include CXXFLAGS=-g LDFLAGS=-L/opt/lib

More details on the build and installation process and other available targets
and options can be found in the Makefile.

PREDEFINED BUILD TYPES
---------- ----- -----

For convenience, 'configure' provides some options to set up CPPFLAGS and
CXXFLAGS for various build types.

Note that, as of Pure 0.3, the default build already includes most
optimizations (-O2). This build should be ok for most purposes, and has the
advantage that it does additional runtime checks which provide diagnostics
useful for maintainers if anything is wrong with the interpreter. However, you
can also build a "release" version of the interpreter by running configure as
follows:

$ ./configure --enable-release

This disables all runtime checks and debugging information in the interpreter,
and uses a higher optimization level (-O3). The release build will usually
give you faster execution times, but the differences to the default build
aren't really that big anymore (less than 5% compared to the default flags on
my Linux system running gcc 4.1, YMMV), so you are encouraged to use the
default build unless performance is really critical.

To get smaller executables with either the default or the release build, add
'LDFLAGS=-s' to the 'configure' command (gcc only, other compilers may provide
a similar flag or a separate command to strip compiled executables and
libraries).

You can also do a "debug" build as follows:

$ ./configure --enable-debug

This is like the default build, but disables all optimizations, so compilation
is faster but the compiled interpreter is *much* slower (a factor of about 2
on my Linux box). Hence this build is only recommended for debugging purposes.

You can combine all build types with the following option to enable compiler
warnings (-Wall):

$ ./configure --enable-warnings

This option is useful to check the interpreter sources for questionable
constructs which might actually be bugs. However, for some older gcc versions
it spits out lots of bogus warnings, so it is not enabled by default.

In addition, there is an option to build a "monolithic" interpreter which is
linked statically against the LLVM libraries, instead of producing a separate
runtime library:

$ ./configure --disable-shared

We strongly discourage from using this option, since it drastically increases
the size of the executable and thereby the memory footprint of the interpreter
if several interpreter processes are running simultaneously. We only provide
this as a workaround for systems on which LLVM refuses to be linked into
shared libraries.

GSL support should be enabled automatically, if the GSL libraries and headers
are available on your system. If configure fails to find these then you may
have to set CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS accordingly and/or use --enable-gsl to
forcibly enable GSL support. You can also specify --disable-gsl if you don't
want/need the GSL matrices, but this isn't recommended.

RUNNING PURE FROM THE SOURCE DIRECTORY
------- ---- ---- --- ------ ---------

After your build is done, you can (and should) also run 'make check' to verify
that your Pure interpreter works correctly. This can be done without
installing the software. In fact, there's no need to install the interpreter
at all if you just want to take it for a test drive, you can simply run it
from the source directory, if you set up the following environment variables
(this assumes that you built Pure in the source directory; when using a
separate build directory, you'll have to change the paths accordingly):

- LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. This is required on Linux systems so that libpure.so
  is found. Other systems may require an analogous setting, or none at all.

- PURELIB=./lib This is required on all systems so that the interpreter finds
  the prelude and other library scripts.

After that you should be able to run the Pure interpreter from the source
directory, by typing './pure'.

OTHER TARGETS
----- -------

The Makefile supports the usual 'clean' and 'distclean' targets, and
'realclean' will remove all files created by the maintainer, including test
logs and C++ source files generated from Flex and Bison grammars. (Only use
the latter if you know what you are doing, since it will remove files which
require special tools to be regenerated.)

There also are a number of targets like 'html' (this requires rman) and 'pdf'
(this requires groff) which generate the documentation in a variety of
formats; see the Makefile for details.

Maintainers can roll distribution tarballs with 'make dist' and 'make
distcheck' (the latter is like 'make dist', but also does a test build and
installation to verify that your tarball contains all needed bits and pieces).

Last but not least, if you modify configure.ac for some reason then you can
regenerate the configure script and config.h.in with 'make config'. This needs
autoconf, of course. (The distribution was prepared using autoconf 2.61.)


SYSTEM NOTES
====== =====

Pure is known to work on recent Linux and Mac OSX versions under x86, x86-64
and ppc, as well as on MS Windows, but there are a few system-specific quirks
which are discussed below. (Please also see the CAVEATS AND NOTES section of
the manual page for information on other known limitations of the current
implementation.)

ALL PLATFORMS
--- ---------

Compiling the default and release versions using gcc with all warnings turned
on (-Wall) will give you the warning "dereferencing type-punned pointer will
break strict-aliasing rules" at some point in util.cc. This is harmless and
can be ignored.

If your Pure program runs out of stack space, the interpreter will segfault.
This is *not* a bug, it happens because runtime stack checks are disabled by
default for performance reasons. You can enable stack checks by setting the
PURE_STACK environment variable accordingly; see the pure(1) manual page for
details. The interpreter will then generate orderly "stack fault" exceptions
in case of a stack overflow.

64 BIT SYSTEMS
-- --- -------

64 bit systems are fully supported by Pure. However, you'll need to patch up
LLVM 2.3 so that it can be linked into the Pure runtime library on x86-64
systems. You also have to configure LLVM with --enable-pic. The patch by
Cyrille Berger, which is to be applied in the llvm-2.3 source directory, is
available at http://pure-lang.sf.net/X86JITInfo.cpp.pic.2.3.patch.

LINUX
-----

Linux is the primary development platform for this software, and the sources
should build out of the box on all recent Linux distributions.

Binary packages for openSUSE are maintained by Toni Graffy as part of the
Packman project: http://packman.links2linux.de/package/pure

Alvaro Castro Castilla has contributed a Gentoo ebuild, which is currently
available at http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231966.

We're still looking for people who can maintain Debian and Fedora packages,
please let us know if you want to help with that.

MAC OSX
--- ---

Pure works fine on OSX, and a port by Ryan Schmidt exists in the MacPorts
collection, see http://www.macports.org/.

Note that with at least some versions of the Apple gcc compiler, with all
warnings turned on you'll get the (bogus) warning "control reaches end of
non-void function" a couple of times in interpreter.cc. These are due to a bug
in older gcc versions (see http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16558),
but they are harmless and can be ignored. These warnings should also go away
once Apple upgrades its SDK to a newer gcc version.

MS WINDOWS
-- -------

Thanks to Jiri Spitz' perseverance, tireless testing and bug reports, the
sources compile and run fine on Windows now, using the Mingw port of the GNU
C++ compiler and the MSYS environment from http://www.mingw.org/. Just do the
usual './configure && make && make install'. You'll need LLVM, of course
(which builds with Mingw just fine), and a few additional libraries for which
headers and precompiled binaries are available from the Pure website
(http://pure-lang.sf.net/).

A binary package in msi format is available as well (see "Downloads" on the
Pure website), which includes all required libraries and some shortcuts to run
the Pure interpreter and read online documentation in html help format, as
well as "PurePad", an alternative GUI frontend for editing and running Pure
scripts on Windows.
