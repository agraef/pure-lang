pure-avahi: Pure Avahi Interface
================================

.. default-domain:: pure
.. module:: avahi

Version @version@, |today|

Albert Gräf <aggraef@gmail.com>

This is a simple interface to Avahi_, a Zeroconf_ implementation for Linux and
other Un*x systems. The module lets you publish and query Zeroconf network
services using Avahi, allowing you to establish connections for various kinds
of TCP and UDP network services without having to manually configure network
addresses. It is typically used along with the :mod:`sockets` module which
lets you create the network connections discovered with :mod:`avahi`.

.. _Zeroconf: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking

To keep things simple and easy to use, the module only exposes the most
essential functionality of Ahavi right now, but the provided functions should
hopefully be sufficient for most programs which require interoperability with
other Avahi or Apple Bonjour applications. One known limitation is that the
module allows you to publish and discover services in the default Avahi domain
only. Typically this is the ``local`` domain, limiting you to services in the
local network.  However, this should cover most common uses of Zeroconf.

There's a companion :mod:`bonjour` module which implements the same API for
Bonjour_, Apple's Zeroconf implementation. Since both modules implement the
same functions, albeit in different namespaces, they can be used as drop-in
replacements for each other. We also offer a compatibility module named
``zeroconf`` which can be used with either pure-avahi or pure-bonjour in a
transparent fashion, so that no source changes are needed when switching the
underlying implementation; please check the zeroconf.pure script included in
the sources for details.

This module is in its early stages, so it may still contain bugs or lack some
features. Please report bugs on the issue tracker at the Pure Bitbucket site,
and use the Pure mailing list for general discussion of the module.

Installation
============

Get the latest source from
https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-avahi-@version@.tar.gz.

Run ``make`` to compile the module and ``make install`` (as root) to install
it in the Pure library directory. This requires GNU make, and of course you
need to have Pure and Avahi installed. The latter should be readily available
on most Linux systems, and ports are available for BSD systems as well.

``make`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory and platform-specific
setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables manually, please
check the Makefile for details.

Please note that the zeroconf.pure compatibility module is not installed by
default, so you may want to copy it to the Pure library directory if needed.

Usage
=====

To use the operations of this module, you need to have Avahi installed and the
Avahi daemon running on your system. The details of this depend on the
particular system that you use, so please consult the documentation of your
Linux or BSD distribution for instructions.

The following import declaration loads the functions of the avahi module in
your Pure script::

  using avahi;

All operations are in the ``avahi`` namespace, so you might want to add the
following declaration to access the functions using their unqualified
identifiers::

  using namespace avahi;

Publishing Services
===================

These functions allow you to advertise a network service using Avahi, so that
the service can be discovered by other applications participating in the
Zeroconf protocol. Each service has a name (a string which uniquely identifies
the service), a type (indicating the application and transport protocols
utilized by the service) and a port number (TCP or UDP port number, depending
on the service type). The service type normally takes the form ``_app._tcp``
(for TCP services) or ``_app._udp`` (for UDP), where ``_app`` specifies the
protocol of the particular application (such as ``_ipp`` for network-connected
printers, or ``_osc`` for applications speaking the OSC a.k.a. Open Sound
Control protocol).

.. function:: avahi::publish name stype port

   Advertise a service in the local domain, given by its name (a string),
   service type (a string) and (TCP or UDP) port number (an integer). Note
   that this operation is actually carried out asynchronously. Use
   :func:`avahi::check` below to wait for and report the result of the
   operation. The returned result is a pointer to the service object which can
   be passed to the following operations, or ``NULL`` in case of error. (A
   ``NULL`` pointer can be passed safely to :func:`avahi::check`; it will fail
   in this case.) The service will be unpublished automatically when the
   service object is garbage-collected.

.. function:: avahi::check service

   Check for the result of a :func:`avahi::publish` operation. This blocks
   until a result is available. A negative integer value indicates failure (in
   this case the result is the Avahi error code). Otherwise the result is a
   triple with the actual service name, type and port. Note that the name may
   be different from the one passed to :func:`avahi::publish` if there was a
   name collision with another service. Such collisions are resolved
   automatically by tacking on a suffix of the form ``#n`` to the service
   name.

Discovering Services
====================

These functions let you discover services of a given service type. For each
(resolvable) service you'll be able to retrieve the corresponding network
address and port, which is what you'll need to actually open a network
connection to communicate with the service.

.. function:: avahi::browse stype

   Browse available services of a given type in the local domain. This
   operation is carried out asynchronously; use :func:`avahi::avail` below to
   check whether new information is available, and :func:`avahi::get` to
   retrieve the actual service list. The result returned by
   :func:`avahi::browse` is a pointer to the browser object which can be
   passed to the following operations, or ``NULL`` in case of error. (A
   ``NULL`` pointer can be passed safely to the other operations; they will
   fail in this case.) Any resources allocated to the browser will be released
   automatically when the browser object is garbage-collected.

.. function:: avahi::avail browser

   Check whether the service information was updated since the last invocation
   of :func:`avahi::get`. Returns an integer (truth value), which may also be
   negative (indicating the Avahi error code) in case of error.

.. function:: avahi::get browser

   Retrieve the current list of services. Each list entry is a tuple with the
   name, type, domain, IP address (all string values) and port number (an
   integer) of a service. The entries are in the same order as returned by
   Avahi, but only include services whose network addresses can actually be
   resolved using Avahi. Note that this information may change over time, as
   new services are announced on the network or removed from it. An
   application will typically call :func:`avahi::avail` from time to time to
   check whether new information is available and then retrieve the updated
   service list using :func:`avahi::get`. The result may also be a negative
   integer (indicating the Avahi error code) in case of error.

Example
=======

Here's an example showing how to publish an UDP OSC (Open Sound Control)
service which might be used to connect to mobile OSC applications such as
hexler's TouchOSC::

  using avahi;
  using namespace avahi;

  let s = publish "OSC Server" "_osc._udp" 8000;
  check s;

The last line checks for the result of the operation and returns the actual
service name, type and port number if all went well. A TouchOSC instance
running on the local network will then offer you to connect to the service.

Continuing the example, here's how you can obtain a list of OSC services
currently available on your local network::

  let t = browse "_osc._udp";
  avail t;
  get t;

If you're running TouchOSC somewhere on your local network, it will be listed
there, along with our own service which we published above. The call in the
second line can be used to check whether any new information is available.
Applications typically invoke these two from time to time to update their
service list, using code like the following::

  avail t && get t;
