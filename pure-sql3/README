This document describes Peter Summerland's Sqlite3_ module, named **Sql3**,
for the Pure_ programming language.

Note: This manual is work in progress and mostly unfinished at this time.

Introduction
============

Sqlite3_ is an extremely popular embedded database engine Like other database
programs it has its quirks and has some very powerful features that cannot be
accessed through the generic OBCD interface.

Sql3 is a minimal wrapper around Sqlite3's C interface that is designed to
give the developer access to all of Sqlite3's features in a way that is
convenient for Pure programmers. It provides a handful of convenience
functions that make the "core" functions in the interface easier to use, while
at the same time "keeping out of the way" so the user can tap into the rest of
the C interface directly.

Installation
============

You need to have Pure and SQLite3_ installed, obviously. Run ``make`` to
compile the module, and ``sudo make install`` to install it in the Pure
library directory.

Usage
=====

In the following it is assumed that the reader has some familiarity with
SQLite3 and its C interface, and has read `An Introduction To The SQLite C/C++
Interface`_.

Note: Further examples can be found in the examples subdirectory in the
sources.

Simple Example
--------------

::

  > using sql3;

  > //open a database
  > let db1 = sql3::open "abc.db";

  > // add a table
  > let ec = sql3::dbexec db1 "create table TT (name varchar, age integer)";

  > // populate it
  > let stm = sql3::prep db1 "ci" "insert into TT values (?,?)";
  > sql3::exec stm ("Sam",20);
  > sql3::exec stm ("Fred",22);

  > // query it
  > let stm = sql3::prep db1 "ci:i" "select * from TT where age > ?";
  > sql3::exec stm 21;
  [["Fred",22]]
  > sql3::exec stm 18;
  [["Sam",20],["Fred",22]]

The functions used in the example have a one to one correspondence to
functions in the Sqlite3 C interface.

* ``sql3::dbopen`` is just a wrapper around ``sqlite3_open_v2``. It puts a
  sentry on the ``sqlite3*`` pointer returned by sqlite3_open to provide for
  automatic closing and some other stuff.

* ``sql3::dbexec``, applied to a ``db`` is just a convenience function for
  executing quick and dirty parameterless commands.

* ``sql3::prep`` is just a wrapper around ``sqlite3_prepare_v2``. It puts a
  sentry on the ``sqlite3_stmt*`` returned by ``sqlite3_prepare_v2`` to
  provide for automatic finalization, coordanation with its db connection, and
  some additional functionality. The extra parameter, compared to the
  underlying C interface function, is a string, referred to as the "type
  string", that specifies what functions from the ``sqlite3_bind_xxx`` and
  ``sqlite3_column_xxx`` families are to be applied when the ``stm`` is
  executed. In second use in the example ``"ci:i"`` means use
  ``sqlite_bind_int64`` to the ``"?"`` in the sql statement and use
  ``sqlite_column_text`` and ``sqlite3_column_int64`` to retrieve the results
  when ``stm`` is executed.

* ``sql3::exec``, applied to ``stm`` is just a convenience function that handles
  the bind, step, column, reset cycle provided by Sqlite's C interface. As
  mentioned the programmer controls exactly which members of the
  ``sqlite3_bind`` and ``sqlite3_column`` are used by specifying them in the
  extra parameter to ``sql3::prep``.

These basic functions present the core functionality of Sqlite3 and
in many cases are all you need to know to get up and running.
