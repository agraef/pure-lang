Introduction
============

SQLite is a software library that implements an easy to use,
self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL
database engine. SQLite is not intended to be an enterprise database
engine like Oracle or PostgreSQL. Instead, SQLite strives to be small,
fast, reliable, and above all simple. See `Appropriate Uses For SQLite`_.

.. _Appropriate Uses For SQLite: http://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html

Sql3 is a wrapper around SQLite's C interface that provides Pure
programers access to almost all of SQLite's features, including many
that are not available through Pure's generic OBCD interface.

Simple Example
--------------

Here is a simple example that opens a database file "readme.db"
(creating it if it does not exist), adds a table "RM", populates "RM"
and executes a query.

::

  pure-sql3$> pure -q
  > 

  > using sql3; using namespace sql3;

  > let dbp = open "readme.db";

  > exec dbp "create table if not exists RM (name text, age integer)";

  > exec dbp "delete from RM";

  > let sp1 = prep dbp "ci" "insert into RM values (?,?)";

  > exec sp1 ("Sam",20);

  > exec sp1 ("Fred",22);

  > let sp2 = prep dbp "ci:i" "select * from RM where age > ?";

  > exec sp2 18;
  [["Sam",20],["Fred",22]]

The Sql3 functions, ``open``, ``prep`` and ``exec`` encapsulate the
core functionality of SQLite, and in many cases are all you need to
use SQLite effectively. 

More Examples
-------------

The examples subdirectory of pure-Sql3 contains several files that
further illustrate basic usage as well as some of Sql3's more
sophisticated features. These include readme.pure, a short file that
contains the examples included herein.

SQLite Documentation
--------------------

SQLite's home page provides excellent documentation regarding its SQL
dialect as well as its C interface. Comments in this document
regarding SQLite are not meant to be a substitute for the actual
documentation and should not be relied upon, other than as general
observations which may or may not be accurate.  The best way to use
Sql3 is to get familiar with SQLite and its C interface and go
directly to the `SQLite Site Map`_ for authoritative answers to any
specific questions that you might have.

.. _`SQLite Site Map`: http://www.sqlite.org/sitemap.html

In the rest of this document, it is assumed the reader has some
familiarity with SQLite and has read `An Introduction To The SQLite
C/C++ Interface`_.

.. _An Introduction To The SQLite C/C++ Interface:
    http://www.sqlite.org/cintro.html

Sqlite3 - The SQLite Command-Line Utility
-----------------------------------------

The SQLite library includes a really nice command-line utility named
sqlite3 (or sqlite3.exe on windows) that allows the user to manually
enter and execute SQL statements against a SQLite database (and much
more).

.. http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html

This tool is an invaluable aid when working with SQLite in general and
with Sql3 in the Pure interpreter in particular. For example, after
entering the Pure statements from the Simple Example above, you could
start a new terminal, cd to pure-sql3, type "sqlite3 readme.db" at the
prompt, and see the effect the Pure statements had on the database: ::

  pure-sql3$> sqlite3 readme.db
  SQLite version 3.6.16
  Enter ".help" for instructions
  Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"

  sqlite> select * from RM;
  Sam|20
  Fred|22

Needless to say, for bottom up REPL development, sqlite3 and Pure are
a dynamite combination.

Installation
============

Unless you already have them on your machine, download SQLite and
sqlite3 from the SQLite website and install as indicated. To install
Sql3, cd to the pure-sql3 directory, run ""make"", and then run ""sudo
make install"" (on Linux).

Data Structure
==============

As far as the SQLite C interface is concerned, the most important
"data structures" are sqlite3* and sqlite3_stmt*, which are pointers
to the following two SQLite objects.

* Database connection object - sqlite3
* Prepared statement object  - sqlite3_stmt

The Sql3 functions ``open`` and ``prep`` return "sentry-guarded"
pointers to database connection objects and prepared statement
objects, respectively. The pointers returned by these two functions
are refered to herein as ``db_ptrs`` and ``stmt_ptrs``.

A db_ptr or a stmt_ptr is, as far as SQLite is concerned, the same as
a sqlite3* returned by ``sqlite3_open_v2`` or a sqlite3_stmt* returned
by ``sqlite3_prepare_v2``, the SQLite C interface functions
corresponding to ``open`` and ``prep``. Thus, db_ptrs and stmt_ptrs
can be used when calling functions provided by the SQLite C interface
(See `Accessing the Rest of SQLite's C Interface`_).

Core Database Operations
========================

The core database operations are (a) opening and closing database
connections and (b) preparing, executing and closing prepared
statements.

Database Connections
--------------------

Generally speaking, the first step in accessing a database is to open
a database connection and obtain a db_ptr that references the database
connection. Once the db_ptr is obtained, it can be used to construct
prepared statements for updating and querying the database. The last
step is usually to close the database connection (although this is
often done automatically by Sql3 when the db_ptr goes out of scope).

Opening a Database Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Sql3 ``open`` contructs a database connection and returns a db_ptr
that refers the connection.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="open">

.. _open:

``open (file_path::string [,access_mode::int,custom_bindings]])``
  opens a SQLite database file whose name is given by the file_path
  argument and returns a db_ptr for the associated database connection
  object created by SQLite.

Example::

  >  let dbp2 = open "abc.db"; dbp2;
  #<pointer 0x992dff8>

If the filename is ":memory:", then a private, temporary in-memory database
is created for the connection.

The basic access modes are:

* SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY - the database is opened in read-only mode. If the
  database does not already exist, an error is returned.

* SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE - the database is opened for reading and writing if
  possible, or reading only if the file is write protected by the operating
  system. In either case the database must already exist, otherwise an
  error is returned.

* SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE | SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE - the database is opened for
  reading and writing, and is creates it if it does not already exist. This
  is the default value that is used if the flags argument is omitted.

* SQLITE_OPEN - an alias for SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE | SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE
  provided by Sql3.

These flags can be combined with SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX
SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE
to control SQLite's threading and shared cache features. All of these
flags are exported by Sql3.

The optional custom_bindings argument allows the user to set up
customized binding and fetching behavior for prepared statements
associated with the returned db_ptr. (See `Custom Binding Types for
Prepared Statements`_)

Failure to Open a Database Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If SQLite cannot open the connection, it still returns a pointer to a
database connection object that must be closed. In this case, ``open``
automatically closes the the connection object and then throws an
exception. E.g.,::

  > catch error (open ("RM_zyx.db",SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY));
  error (sql3::db_error 14 "unable to open database file [open RM_zyx.db]")


SQLite does not check to see that a file is a valid SQLite database
when it opens it. If the file is corrupted SQLite will return and
error when the connection is used.

Testing a db_ptr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For argument checking and other purposes Sql3 provides the following
functions:

.. raw:: html

   <a name="is_db_ptr">

.. _is_db_ptr:

``is_db_ptr ptr::pointer``
  returns 1 if ptr is a db_ptr returned by open, and 0 if it is not.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="is_open">

.. _is_open:

``is_open ptr::pointer``
  returns 1 if the database connection referenced by by ptr is open.

Closing a Database Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a database connection object is no longer needed, it should be closed
so that SQLite can free the associated resources.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="close">

.. _close:

``close dbp::pointer``
  if the database connection referenced by the db_ptr dbp is open,
  close it using sqlite3_close; otherwise do nothing.

Before calling ``sqlite3_close``, ``close`` finalizes all prepared
statements associated with the connection being closed. Sql3 will
detect and throw a db_error if an attempt is subseqently made to
execute a statement associated with the closed database connection. ::

  > let dbp2_sp = prep dbp2 "ci:" "select * from RM";

  > exec dbp2_sp ();
  [["Sam",20],["Fred",22]]

  > close dbp2;

  > catch error (exec dbp2_sp);
  error (sql3::db_error 0 "Attempt to exec on a closed db.")

If a db_ptr goes out of scope, Sql3 will automatically call
``sqlite3_close`` to close the referenced database connection, but
only if the connection has not already been closed by ``close``. 

When debugging, this activity can be observed by editing sql3.pure,
changing "const SHOW_OPEN_CLOSE = 0;" to "const SHOW_OPEN_CLOSE = 1;"
and running sudo make install in the pure-sql3 directory. This will
cause a message to be printed whenever a db_ptr or stmt_ptr is created
or finalized.

N.B. You should never call ``sqlite3_close`` with a db_ptr. If the
referenced database connectin is closed by such a call, a subsequent
call to ``close`` on this db+ptr (including the call that will
automatically occur when the db_ptr goes out of scope) will cause a
seg fault.

Prepared Statements
-------------------

In SQLite, prepared statement objects are used to execute SQL
statements using the following SQLite C interface functions.

* sqlite3_prepare_v2
* sqlite3_bind
* sqlite3_step
* sqlite3_column
* sqlite3_finalize

Using the C interface, the basic procedure is to prepare a statement
using ``sqlite3_prepare_v2', bind its parameters using `sqlite3_bind`,
step it using ``sqlite3_step`` one or more times until it is done and
then finalize it using ``sqlite3_finalize``. Each time
``sqlite3_step`` returns SQLITE_ROW, use ``sqlite3_column`` to fetch
the row's values. Here ``sqlite3_bind`` and ``sqlite3_column``
represent families of bind and column functions, rather than actual
functions, with one member for each of the basic data types recognized
by SQLite. Thus, for example, ``sqlite_bind_double`` is the function
one would use to bind a prepared statement with an argument of type
double.

Sql3 captures these procedures in four functions: ``prep``, ``exec``,
``lexec`` and ``finalize``.

Constructing Prepared Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Sql3 use ``prep`` to construct a prepared statement and obtain a
stmt_ptr that refers to it.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="prep">

.. _prep:

``prep dbp::pointer binding_string::string sql_statement::string``

  constructs a prepared statement object and returns a stmt_ptr that
  references it. "dbp" must be a db_ptr or the rule will not
  match. "sql_statement" is the SQL statement that will be executed
  when the prepared statement is passed to ``exec``.

Basically, ``prep`` just passes dbp and sql_statement on to
``sqlite3_prepare_v2 and returns a sentry guarded version of the
sqlite3_stmt* it receives back from ``sqlite3_prepare_v2``. SQL
statements passed to ``prep`` (and ``sqlite3_prepare_v2``) can have
argument placeholders, indicated by "?", "?nnn", ":AAA", etc, in which
case the argument placeholders must be bound to values using
``sqlite_bind`` before the prepared statement is passed to
``sqlite3_step``.  Hence the binding_string, which is used by Sql3 to
determine how to bind the prepared statement's argument placeholders,
if any. The binding string also tells Sql3 how to fetch values in the
``sqlite3_column`` step of the basic prepare, bind, step, fetch,
finalize cycle dictated by the SQlite C interface.

In the following two examples, the "c" and "i" in the binding strings
indicate that a string and an int will be used to bind sp1, an int
will be used to bind sp2 and that sp2, when executed, will return a
result set in the form of a list of sublists each of which contains a
string and an int. ::

  > let sp1 = prep dbp "ci" "insert into RM values (?,?)";

  > let sp2 = prep dbp "ci:i" "select * from RM where age > ?";

In general, the characters in the type string before the ":", if any,
indicate the types in the result set. Those that occur after the ":",
if any, indicate the types of the arguments used to bind the prepared
statement object. If the type string does not contain a ":", the
characters in the type string, if any, are the types of binding
arguments.

Sql3 provides the following set of "core" binding types:

==== ================ ===========
Type Pure Argument    SQLite Type
==== ================ ===========
b    (int, pointer)   blob
c    string           text (utf8)
d    double           float
i    int              int
k    int or bigint    int64
l    bigint           blob
n    Sql3::SQLNULL    NULL
x    expression       blob
v    variant          variant
==== ================ ===========

The "**b**" or blob type is different from the rest in that the Pure
argument is specified as a pair. The first element of the pair
indicates the length in bytes of the object to be stored and the
second element indicates its location in memory. The "**c**" type
stands for string (as in "char*"), "**d**" stands for double and
"**i**" stands for int.  The "**k**" type stands for "key" and maps
Pure ints and bigints within the range of int64 to int64 values in the
database.  This type is useful when dealing with SQLite's "integer
primary keys" and "rowids" both of which are int64.  The "**l**" type,
in contrast applies to all bigints (and not to ints) and it maps
bigints onto blobs, which are generally meaningless in SQL math
expressions.  The "**n**" type can only appear on the binding side of
a type string. The "**v**" type stands for any of "b", "c", "d", "i"
or "n", based on the type of the binding argument. A "v" type will be
fetched from SQLite according to the native SQLite column type of the
corresponding column.  The "**x**" type is used to store and
reconstruct Pure expressions as binary objects, using the ``val`` and
``blob`` functions provided by the Pure system module.

Users can define custom binding types and pass them as a third
parameter to ``open``. The resulting db_ptr can be used with the
additional binding types to construct prepared statements that can be
executed with the  customized argument types.

Testing a stmt_ptr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For argument checking and other purposes it is sometimes useful to
determine if a given expression is a valid stmt_ptr.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="is_stmt_ptr">

.. _is_stmt_ptr:

``is_stmt_ptr ptr::pointer``
  returns 1 if ptr is a stmt_ptr, otherwise returns 0.

Executing Prepared Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Sql3, the bind, step, column, step, column ... cycle is encapsulated in
the ``exec`` and ``lexec`` functions.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="exec">

.. _exec:

``exec sp::pointer args`` 
  use args to bind the prepared statement referenced by sp, execute it
  and return the result set as a list. The first parameter, "sp" must
  be a valid stmt_ptr or the rule will fail.

The second, "args" parameter is a tuple or list of arguments whose
number and type correspond to the bind parameter types specified in
the call to ``prep`` that produced the first parmenter "sp".

Example::

  > exec sp1 ("Tom",30);  //insert Tom
  []

  > exec sp2 19;          //select age > 19
  [["Sam",20],["Fred",22],["Tom",30]]

  > exec dbp "delete from RM where name='Tom'";

An error is thrown if the args do not correspond to the specified types. ::

  > catch error (exec sp2 "a");
  error (sql3::db_error 0 "Attempt to bind a \"a\" as a int")

If a prepared statement does not have any binding parameters,
the call to exec should use () as the binding argument. ::

  > let sp3 = prep dbp "c:" "select name from RM";

  > exec sp3 ();
  [["Sam"],["Fred"]]

Extra care is required when executing prepared statements that take a
blob argument because it must be a pair. In order to preserve the
tuple as a pair, binding arguments that include a blob should passed
to exec as a list. If passed as a member of a larger tuple, it will be
treated as two arguments due to the nature of tuples. ::

  > let blb = (100,ptr);

  > (a,blb,c);
  a,100,ptr,c

  > [a,blb,c];
  [a,(100,ptr),c]

Thus something like "exec stpx [a,blb,c]" would work fine, while "exec
stpx (a,blb,c)" would produce a Sql3 binding exception.

Executing Lazily
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``exec`` function returns result sets as eager lists which can
sometimes be inefficient or simply not feasible for large result
sets. In such cases it is preferable to use ``lexec`` instead of
``exec``.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="lexec">

.. _lexec:

``lexec stmp::pointer args``
  same as ``exec`` except that it returns a lazy list.

Example::

  > lexec sp2 19;
  ["Sam",20]:#<thunk 0xb6475ab0>

Note that no changes to sp2 were required. In addition, for most
purposes the lazy list returned by ``lexec`` can be processed by the
same code that processed the eager list returned by ``exec``.

Executing Directly on a db_ptr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For statements that have no parameters and which do not return results,
``exec`` can be applied to a db_ptr.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="exec_db dbp">

.. _exec dbp:

``exec dbp::pointer sql_statement::string``
  constructs a temporary prepared statement using the sql_statement,
  which cannot contain argument placeholders.

Example::

  > exec dbp "create table if not exists RM (name varchar, age integer)";

.. _Executing Against a Busy Database:

Executing Against a Busy Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SQLite allows multiple processes to concurrently read a single
database, but when any process wants to write, it locks the entire
database file for the duration of its update.

When ``sqlite3_step`` tries to access a file that is locked by another
process, it treats the database as "busy and returns the SQLITE_BUSY
error code. If this happens in a call to ``exec`` or ``lexec``, a
db_busy_ exception will be thrown. 

You can adjust SQLite's behavior using ``sqlite3_busy_handler`` or
``sqlite3_busy_timeout``.

If the statement is a COMMIT or occurs outside of an explicit
transaction, then you can retry the statement. If the statement is not
a COMMIT and occurs within a explicit transaction then you should
rollback the transaction before continuing.

Grouping Execution with Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No changes can be made to a SQLite database file except within a
transaction. Transactions can be started manually by executing a BEGIN
statement. Manually started transactions persist until the next COMMIT
or ROLLBACK statement is executed. Transactions are also ended if an
error occurs before the transaction is manually ended using a COMMIT
or ROLLBACK statement. This behavior provides the means make a series
of changes "atomically."

By default, SQLite operates in autocommit mode. In autocommit mode,
any SQL statement that changes the database (basically, anything other
than SELECT) will automatically start a transaction if one is not
already in effect. As opposed to manually started transactions,
automatically started transactions are committed as soon as the
execution of the related statement completes.

The upshot of this, in Sql3 terms, is that unless a transaction is
started manually, the database will be updated each time ``exec`` is
called. For a long series of updates or inserts this a can be very
slow. The way to avoid this problem is to manually begin and end
transactions manually.

Transactions created using BEGIN...COMMIT do not nest. For nested
transactions, use the SAVEPOINT and RELEASE statements. 

Sql3 provides the following convenience functions all of which simply
call ``exec`` with the appropriate statement. For example ``begin``
dbp is exactly the same as ``exec`` dbp "BEGIN".

.. _begin:
.. _begin_exclusive:
.. _begin_immediate:
.. _commit:
.. _savepoint:
.. _release:
.. _rollback_to:
.. _rollback:

* begin dbp::pointer
* begin_exclusive dbp::pointer
* begin_immediate dbp::pointer
* commit dbp::pointer
* rollback dbp::pointer
* savepoint dbp::pointer save_point::string
* release dbp::pointer  save_point::string
* rollback_to dbp::pointer  save_point::string

Finalizing Prepared Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a prepared statement is no longer needed it should be finalized
so that SQLite can free the associated resources.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="finalize">

.. _finalize:

``finalize sp::pointer``
  finalize the prepared statement referenced by sp, which must be a
  stmt_ptr previously returned by ``prep``.

Often there is no need to call ``finalize`` for a given stmt_ptr
because it will be automatically called when the stmt_ptr goes out of
scope. 

If the stmt_ptr is associated with a database connection that has been
closed (which would have caused an exception to be thrown), an attempt
to finalize it, including the automatic finalization can occur when
stmt_ptr goes out of scope, will cause and exception to be thrown.

  > catch error (finalize dbp2_sp);
  error (sql3::db_error 0 "finalize: STMT attached to a closed database.")

Multiple calls to ``finalize`` are fine. In contrast the corresponding
native C interface function, ``sqlite3_finalize`` will cause a seg
fault if called with a pointer to a finalized prepared statement
object. This is the main reason why you should never call
``sqlite3_finalize`` with a stmt_ptr. If the prepared statement
referenced by the stmt_ptr is finalized by such a call, a subsequent
call to ``finalize`` with the stmt_ptr (including the call that will
automatically occur when the stmt_ptr goes out of scope) will cause a
seg fault.

Exceptions
----------

Sql3 throws two types of exceptions, one for outright errors and one
for database "busy" conditions.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="db_error">

.. _db_error:

db_error
~~~~~~~~

When a Sql3 function detects an error it throws an exception of the
form "db_error ec msg" where ec is and error code and msg is the
corresponding error message. If ec>0, the error was detected by SQLite
itself, and ec and msg are those returned by SQLite. If ec==0, the
error was detected by Sql3 and msg is a Sql3 specific description of
the error. E.g., ::

  >db_error_handler (db_error ec msg) = ()
  >when
  >  source = if ec > 0 then "SQLite" else "Sql3";
  >  printf "%s db_error: ec %d, %s\n" (source,ec,msg);
  >db_error_handler x = throw x;

  >catch db_error_handler (exec dbp "select * from NO_TABLE");
  SQLite db_error: ec 1, no such table: NO_TABLE

.. raw:: html

   <a name="db_busy">

.. _db_busy:

db_busy
~~~~~~~

Sql3 functions ``exec`` and ``lexec`` throw exceptions of the form
"db_busy dbp", where dbp is a db_ptr, if they are prevented from
executing succesfully because the database referenced by dbp is
locked (See `Executing Against a Busy Database`_).

SQLite Error Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a list, as of April 2, 2010, SQLite's error codes. ::

  SQLITE_ERROR        1   /* SQL error or missing database */
  SQLITE_INTERNAL     2   /* Internal logic error in SQLite */
  SQLITE_PERM         3   /* Access permission denied */
  SQLITE_ABORT        4   /* Callback routine requested an abort */
  SQLITE_BUSY         5   /* The database file is locked */
  SQLITE_LOCKED       6   /* A table in the database is locked */
  SQLITE_NOMEM        7   /* A malloc() failed */
  SQLITE_READONLY     8   /* Attempt to write a readonly database */
  SQLITE_INTERRUPT    9   /* Operation terminated by sqlite3_interrupt()*/
  SQLITE_IOERR       10   /* Some kind of disk I/O error occurred */
  SQLITE_CORRUPT     11   /* The database disk image is malformed */
  SQLITE_NOTFOUND    12   /* NOT USED. Table or record not found */
  SQLITE_FULL        13   /* Insertion failed because database is full */
  SQLITE_CANTOPEN    14   /* Unable to open the database file */
  SQLITE_PROTOCOL    15   /* NOT USED. Database lock protocol error */
  SQLITE_EMPTY       16   /* Database is empty */
  SQLITE_SCHEMA      17   /* The database schema changed */
  SQLITE_TOOBIG      18   /* String or BLOB exceeds size limit */
  SQLITE_CONSTRAINT  19   /* Abort due to constraint violation */
  SQLITE_MISMATCH    20   /* Data type mismatch */
  SQLITE_MISUSE      21   /* Library used incorrectly */
  SQLITE_NOLFS       22   /* Uses OS features not supported on host */
  SQLITE_AUTH        23   /* Authorization denied */
  SQLITE_FORMAT      24   /* Auxiliary database format error */
  SQLITE_RANGE       25   /* 2nd parameter to sqlite3_bind out of range */
  SQLITE_NOTADB      26   /* File opened that is not a database file */

New error codes may be added in future versions of SQLite. Note that
the SQLite names of the error codes are not exported by the Sql3
module.

Advanced Features
=================

Sql3's advanced features include the ability to implement SQL
functions in Pure, convenient access to the SQLite C interface and
custom binding types.

Custom SQL Functions
--------------------

An extremely powerful (albeit complex) feature of the SQLite C
interface is the ability to add new SQL scalar or aggregate
functions. The new functions can be used in SQL statements the same as
the prepackaged functions and aggregates. Sql3 hides the complexity
and seamlessly integrates all of this functionality, :), into Pure via
``create_function``. This function is used to register both scalar SQL
functions and aggregate SQL functions with SQlite.

Scalar SQL Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a custom SQL scalar function to SQLite by passing a single
Pure function to ``create_function``.

.. raw:: html

   <a name="create_function">

.. _create_function:


``create_function dbp::pointer name::string nargs::int pure_fun``
  registers a new SQL scalar function of nargs arguments that can be
  called, as "name", in SQL statements prepared with respect to dbp, a
  db_ptr. When the SQL function is called in a SQL statement, control
  is passed to pure_fun, a curried function written in Pure. If nargs
  is (-1), the SQL function "name" is variadic, and the arguments will
  be passed to pure_fun as a single list.

Note that ``create_function`` can also register aggregate functions (See
`Aggregate SQL Functions`_).

Here is an example of a scalar function that takes two parameters. Note
that any kind of Pure "function" can be passed here; local functions,
global functions, lambdas or partial applications all work. ::

  >create_function dbp "p_fn" 2 plus with plus x y = x + y; end;

  >let sp4 = prep dbp "cii:" 
  >         "select p_fn('Hi ',name), age, p_fn(age,10) from RM";

  >exec sp4 ();
  [["Hi Sam",20,30],["Hi Fred",22,32]]

Here is an example of a variadic function::

  >create_function dbp "p_qm" (-1) quasimodo with
  >  quasimodo xs = "quasimodo: "+join ":" [str x | x=xs];
  >end;

If the SQL function takes no arguments, the corresponding Pure
function must, for technical reasons in Pure, take a single dummy
argument. E.g., ::

  >create_function dbp "p_count" 0 counter with
  >  counter () = put r (get r+1);
  >end when r = ref 0 end;

Here is how "count" and "quasimodo" might be used::

  

  >let sp5 = prep dbp "ic:" "select p_count(), p_qm(name,age) from RM";

  > exec sp5 ();
  [[1,"quasimodo: \"Sam\":20"],[2,"quasimodo: \"Fred\":22"]]

  > exec sp5 ();
  [[3,"quasimodo: \"Sam\":20"],[4,"quasimodo: \"Fred\":22"]]

Multiple SQL functions can be registered with the same name if they
have differing numbers of arguments. Built-in SQL functions may be
overloaded or replaced by new application-defined functions.

Generally, a custom function is permitted to call other Sql3 and
native SQLite C interface functions. However, such calls must not
close the database connection nor finalize or reset the prepared
statement in which the function is running.

.. _Aggregate SQL Functions:

Aggregate SQL Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use ``create_function`` to register an aggregate SQL function
with SQLIT by passing a triple consisting of two Pure functions and a
start value, in place of a single Pure function.

``create_function dbp::pointer name::string nargs::int (step,final,start)``
  register a new SQL aggregate function of nargs arguments that can
  be called, as "name" in SQL statements prepared with respect to dbp,
  a db_ptr.  "step" and "final" are curried Pure functions and "start" is
  the initial value for the aggregation. The 'step' function is called
  repeatedly to accumulate values from the database, starting from the
  given 'start' value, and finally the 'final' function is applied to
  the accumulated result.

Note that for a single-argument step function, this works exactly as
if the functions were invoked as 'final (foldl step start values)',
where 'values' is the list of aggregated values from the database. ::

  >create_function dbp "p_avg" 1 (step,final,(0,0.0)) with
  >  step (n,a) x = n+1, a+x;
  >  final (n,a) = a/n;
  >end;

  >let sp6 = prep dbp "id:" "select count(name), p_avg(age) from RM";

  >exec sp6 ();
   [[2,21.0]]


.. _Accessing the Rest of SQLite's C Interface:


Accessing the Rest of SQLite's C Interface
------------------------------------------

The db_ptrs returned by ``open`` and stmt_ptrs returned by ``prep``
are the sentry guarded versions of the actual pointers to the data
base connection objects and prepared statement objects returned by the
their corresponding native C interface functions ``sqlite3_open_v2``
and ``sqlite3_prepare_v2``.  This makes it easy to call almost any
external function in SQLite's C interface directly, passing it the
same db_ptr or stmt_ptr that is passed to Sql3's functions, such as
``prep`` or ``exec``.

For example, you can override SQLite's default behavior with respect
to busy databases for the database connection referenced by a db_ptr,
say db, as follows::

  > extern int sqlite3_busy_timeout(sqlite3*, int);

  > sqlite3_busy_timeout dbp 10;

This sets a busy handler that will "sleep and retry" multiple times
until at least 10 milliseconds of sleeping have accumulated.  Calling
this routine with an argument less than or equal to zero turns off all
busy handlers.

Or you might be interested in the the number of database rows that
were changed, inserted or deleted by the most recently completed SQL
statement executed on a given database connection::

  > extern int sqlite3_changes(sqlite3*);

  > exec sp1 ("Harvey",30);

  > sqlite3_changes dbp;
  1

As a final example, in this case using a stmt_ptr, you can determine
name assigned to a column in a result using ``sqlite3_column_name``::

  > extern char *sqlite3_column_name(sqlite3_stmt*, int);
 
  > exec sp2 29;
  [["Harvey",30]]

  > sqlite3_column_name sp2 1;
  "age"

Note that in order to call a native C function you must first make it
accessible using an extern statement.

Note also that directly calling a function provided by the SQLite C
interface can be dangerous, as is the case with any call from Pure code
to an external C function.  Sql3 users should be especially careful in
this regard because using a db_ptr or a stmt_ptr in calls to certain
native C interface functions, including in particular
``sqlite3_close`` and ``sqlite3_finalize``, will corrupt data held by
the db_ptr or stmt_ptr, leading to undefined behavior.

The reason for this restriction is that Sql3 uses sentries to insure
that the resources associated with a db_ptr or a stmt_ptr are
automatically finalized by SQLite when they go out of scope. In
addition, the sentries carry internal information used by Sql3 for
other purposes.


.. _Custom Binding Types for Prepared Statements:

Custom Binding Types for Prepared Statements
--------------------------------------------

You can add your own binding types for preparing and executing
prepared statemts by specifying a third argument to ``open``.  The
third argument must be a list of "hash rocket pairs" in which the left
side is a character for the custom binding type and the right side is
a list with three members. The second and third members of the list
are functions that map objects from the new type to one of the Sql3
core types and back. The first member of the list is the character for
the Sql3 core types referenced by the mapping functions.

The file sql3_user_bind_types.pure in the examples subdirectory shows
how this might be done for a couple of user defined types. The example
script deals with dates and certain Pure expressions as bigints and
native Pure expressions, while the database stores these in utf_8
text. The following snippets show parts of the script that are
relevant to this discussion::

  const custom_binds = [
    "t"=>["c", day_to_str,str_to_day],
    "s"=>["c",str,eval]
  ];

  d1 = str_to_day "2010-03-22";

  db = open ("abc.db", SQLITE_OPEN, custom_binds); 
  stm1 = prep db "cts" "insert into TC values(?,?,?)";  
  exec stm1 ["Manny", d1, s_expr];
  stm3a = sql3::prep db "t:" "select t_date from TC";
  stm3b = sql3::prep db "c:" "select t_date from TC";

Executing stm3a and stm3b from the interpreter shows that TC's date
field is stored as a string, but returned to the Pure script as a
bigint. ::

  > sql3::exec stm3a ());
  [[14691L]]

  > sql3::exec stm3b ());
  [["2010-03-22"]]

The character designating the custom type must not be one of the
letters used to designate Sql3 core binding types.

Threading Modes
===============

SQLite supports three different threading modes:

1. Single-thread. In this mode, all mutexes are disabled and SQLite
   is unsafe to use in more than a single thread at once. 

2. Multi-thread. In this mode, SQLite can be safely used by multiple
   threads provided that no single database connection is used
   simultaneously in two or more threads.

3. Serialized. In serialized mode, SQLite can be safely used by
   multiple threads with no restriction.

SQLite can be compiled with or without support for multithreading and
the default is to support it. 

In many cases, single-thread mode might be appropriate if only because
it is measurably faster. This might be the case, for example, if you
are using SQLite as the on-disk file format for a desktop application.

If your version of SQLite was compiled with support for
multithreading, you can switch to single-thread mode at runtime by calling
sqlite3_config() with the verb SQLITE_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD.

If you must use threads, it is anticipated that Sql3 probably will not
impose an additional burden. Hopefully, you will be fine if you apply
the same precautions to a db_ptr or stm_ptr that you would apply to
the underlying sqlite* and sqlite_stmt*s if you were not using
Sql3. It is strongly advised however that you look at the underlying
Sql3 code to verify that this will work. Since everything that is
imposed between the raw pointers returned by the SQlite interface and
the corresponding db_ptr and stmt_ptrs is written in Pure, it should
be relatively easy to determine how Sql3 and your multithreading
strategy will interact. See `Is SQLite threadsafe?`_ , `Opening A New
Database Connection`_ and `Test To See If The Library Is Threadsafe`_.
