Introduction
============

This module provides a basic interface between Pure and Tcl/Tk. The operations
of this module allow you to execute arbitrary commands in the Tcl interpreter,
set and retrieve variable values in the interpreter, and invoke Pure callbacks
from Tcl/Tk.

A recent version of Tcl/Tk is required (8.0 or later should do). You can get
this from http://www.tcl.tk. Both releases in source form and binary releases
for Windows and various Unix systems are provided there.

Some information on how to use this module can be found below. But you'll find
that pure-tk is very easy to use, so you might just want to look at the
examples in the examples folder to pick it up at a glance. A very basic
example can be found in tk_hello.pure; a slightly more advanced example of a
tiny but complete Tk application is in tk_examp.pure.

Installation
============

As with the other addon modules for Pure, running ``make && sudo make
install`` should usually do the trick. This requires that you have Pure and
Tcl/Tk installed. ``make`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory and
platform-specific setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables
manually. In particular, ``make install prefix=/usr`` sets the installation
prefix. Please see the Makefile for details.

**IMPORTANT:** When starting a new interpreter, the Tcl/Tk initialization code
looks for some initialization files which it executes before anything else
happens. Usually these files will be found without any further ado, but if
that does not happen automatically, you must set the TCL_LIBRARY and
TK_LIBRARY environment variables to point to the Tcl and Tk library
directories on your system.

Basic Usage
===========

You can submit a command to the Tcl interpreter with ``tk cmd`` where ``cmd``
is a string containing the command to be executed. This also starts a new
instance of the Tcl interpreter if it is not already running. To stop the Tcl
interpreter, you can use the ``tk_quit`` function. Note that, as far as
pure-tk is concerned, there's only one Tcl interpreter per process, but of
course you can create additional interpreter instances using the appropriate
Tcl commands.

Simple dialogs can be created directly using Tk's ``tk_messageBox`` and
``tk_dialog`` functions. For instance::

  tk "tk_dialog .warning \"Warning\" \"Are you sure?\" warning 0 Yes No Cancel";

Other kinds of common dialogs are available; see the Tcl/Tk manual for
information.

For more elaborate applications you probably have to explicitly create some
widgets with the appropriate callbacks, and provide a main loop which takes
care of processing events in the Tcl/Tk GUI. We discuss this in the following.

Callbacks
=========

pure-tk installs a special Tcl command named ``pure`` in the interpreter which
can be used to implement callbacks in Pure. This command is invoked from Tcl
as follows::

  pure function args ...

It calls the Pure function named by the first argument. Any remaining
arguments are passed to the callback. Arguments looking like numeric literals
(int or double) are parsed and passed as numbers, everything else is passed as
a string. For instance:

``pure foo``
  calls the Pure function ``foo`` without parameters;

``pure foo bar baz!?``
  invokes ``foo`` as ``foo "bar" "baz!?"``;

``pure foo 1.0 {Hello, world}``
  invokes ``foo`` as ``foo 1.0 "Hello, world"``.

Analogous conversions are applied to the result value, so if the callback
returns a string or a number (int or double) then this becomes the result of
the ``pure`` command in the Tcl interpreter. The callback can also return
multiple values as a tuple, which are converted to a corresponding Tcl
list. Other kinds of Pure values are silently ignored. For instance:

``foo = ();``
  returns nothing;

``foo = 99;``
  returns an integer ``99``;

``foo = 0.0, 1.0, "Hello, world";``
  returns a Tcl list ``0.0 1.0 {Hello, world}`` consisting of two double
  values and a string.

The Main Loop
=============

The easiest way to provide a main loop for your application is to just call
``tk_main`` which keeps processing events in the Tcl interpreter until the
interpreter is exited. You can terminate the interpreter in a Pure callback by
calling ``tk_quit``. Thus a minimalistic Tcl/Tk application coded in Pure may
look as follows::

  using tk;
  tk "button .b -text {Hello, world!} -command {pure tk_quit}; pack .b";
  tk_main;

The main loop terminates as soon as the Tcl interpreter is exited, which can
happen, e.g., in response to a callback which invokes the ``tk_quit`` function
or Tcl code which destroys the main window (``destroy .``). The user can also
close the main window from the window manager in order to exit the main loop.

Accessing Tcl Variables
=======================

pure-tk also allows your script to set and retrieve variable values in the Tcl
interpreter with the ``tk_set``, ``tk_unset`` and ``tk_get`` functions. This
is useful, e.g., to change the variables associated with entry and button
widgets, and to retrieve the current values from the application. For
instance::

  > tk_set "entry_val" "some string";
  "some string"
  > tk_get "entry_val";
  "some string"
  > tk_unset "entry_val";
  ()
  > tk_get "entry_val";
  tk_get "entry_val"

Note that all values are passed as strings here. At the language level, this
is really the only data type that Tcl/Tk knows. (Internally, modern versions
of the Tcl interpreter use more elaborate representations of different kinds
of objects. However, to keep the interface simple, pure-tk doesn't provide
direct access to these, so you'll have to construct them using the appropriate
Tcl commands.)

Tips and Tricks
===============

Here are a few other things that are useful when working with pure-tk.

* Errors in Tcl/Tk commands can be handled by giving an appropriate definition
  of the ``tk_error`` function, which is invoked with an error message as its
  single argument. For instance, the following implementation of ``tk_error``
  throws an exception::

    tk_error msg = throw msg;

  If no definition for this function is provided, then errors cause a literal
  ``tk_error msg`` expression to be returned as the result of the ``tk``
  function. You can then check for such results and take an appropriate
  action.

* The Tcl interpreter, when started, displays a default main window, which is
  required by most Tk applications. If this is not desired (e.g., if only the
  basic Tcl commands are needed), you can hide this window using a ``tk "wm
  withdraw ."`` command. To redisplay the window when it is needed, use the
  ``tk "wm deiconify ."`` command. It is also common practice to use ``wm
  withdraw`` and ``wm deiconify`` while creating the widgets of an
  application, in order to reduce "flickering".

* Instead of calling ``tk_main``, you can also code your own main loop in Pure
  as follows::

    main = do_something $$ main if tk_ready;
         = () otherwise;

  Note that the ``tk_ready`` function checks whether the Tcl interpreter is
  still up and running, after processing any pending events in the
  interpreter. This setup allows you to do your own custom idle processing in
  Pure while the application is running. However, you have to be careful that
  your ``do_something`` routine runs neither too short nor too long (a few
  milliseconds should usually be ok). Otherwise your main loop may turn into a
  busy loop and/or the GUI may become very sluggish and unresponsive. Thus
  it's usually better to just call ``tk_main`` and do any necessary background
  processing using the Tcl interpreter's own facilities (e.g., by setting up a
  Pure callback with the Tcl ``after`` command).

* The ``tk`` function can become rather tedious when coding larger Tk
  applications. Usually, you will prefer to put the commands making up your
  application into a separate Tcl script, and then invoke this script from
  your Pure script using the Tcl ``source`` command, e.g.::

    tk "source myapp.tcl";

  This is also the method to use for running existing Tk applications, e.g.,
  if you create the interface using some interface builder like vtcl_.

.. _vtcl: http://vtcl.sourceforge.net

* The Tcl ``package`` command allows you to load additional extensions into
  the Tcl interpreter at runtime. For instance::

    tk "package require Gnocl";

  This loads Peter G. Baum's Gnocl_ extension which turns Tcl into a frontend
  for `GTK+`_ and Gnome_.

.. _Gnocl: http://www.gnocl.org
.. _GTK+:  http://www.gtk.org/
.. _Gnome: http://www.gnome.org/

* The Tcl ``exit`` procedure, just as in tclsh or wish, causes exit from the
  current process. Since the Tcl interpreter hosted by the pure-tk module runs
  as part of a Pure program and not as a separate child process, ``tk "exit"``
  will also exit from the Pure program and take you back to the shell. If
  you'd like ``exit`` to only exit the Tcl interpreter, without exiting Pure,
  you can redefine the ``exit`` procedure, e.g., as follows::

    tk "proc exit { {returnCode 0} } { pure tk_quit }";

  If you want to do something with the exit code provided by ``exit``, you
  will have to provide an appropriate callback function, e.g.::

    tk "proc exit { {returnCode 0} } { pure quit_cb $returnCode }";

  A suitable implementation of ``quit_cb`` might look as follows::

    quit_cb 0 = puts "Application exited normally." $$ tk_quit;
    quit_cb n = printf "Application exited with exit code %d.\n" n $$
    	      	tk_quit otherwise;

* If you need dialogs beyond the standard kinds of message boxes and common
  dialogs, you will have to do these yourself using a secondary toplevel. The
  dialog toplevel is just like the main window but will only be shown when the
  application needs it. You can construct both non-modal and modal dialogs
  this way, the latter can be implemented using Tk's ``grab`` command.
