This is a module providing access to the Reduce_ computer algebra system from
Pure. It uses an "embedded" version of Reduce which can be provided in the
form of a shared library. The Installation_ section below describes how to
build this library from the Reduce sources. More background information and a
discussion of the interface can be found in the `Embedding REDUCE`_ thread on
the Pure mailing list.

The interface can be found in the reduce.pure module. It has two parts, a
`low-level interface`_ which consists of a number of C entry points supplied
by the Reduce library, and a `high-level interface`_ which provides everything
that the Pure programmer needs to use Reduce from Pure. Please note that at
present this module is still experimental. But the basic functionality works,
and you're welcome to discuss the new interface on the mailing list and/or
submit bug reports and patches.

Installation
============

Get the latest source from
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-reduce-@version@.tar.gz.

You'll need both the Reduce library (named reduce.so, reduce.dylib or
reduce.dll, depending on the system you have) and a Reduce image file
(reduce.img) to make this module work. A Makefile is included with this
package so that you can build these yourself from the Reduce sources. (In
principle, this only needs to be done once for the initial installation of
this module, but you may want to repeat this procedure every once in a while
to get the latest Reduce version.)

You can check out the latest Reduce version from its svn repository with the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

   svn co https://reduce-algebra.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/reduce-algebra/trunk/ reduce-algebra

This may take a while; Reduce is a *big* package. Once it's finished, just
drop the resulting reduce-algebra directory into the pure-reduce source
directory. Run ``make`` and then (if needed) ``make install`` in the
pure-reduce directory (*not* in the reduce-algebra directory!). You should
also run ``make check`` which performs a few tests in order to verify that the
interface works ok (this can be done without installing the package, but needs
the Reduce image and library).

In case the above procedure doesn't work for you, there are more detailed
instructions on how to compile the relevant parts of Reduce in the
pure_reduce.txt file included in the distribution. Also note that the
pure-reduce module requires neither a full Reduce installation nor a full
build of the Reduce package; just the Reduce library and image. Thus the
additional items discussed below are all completely optional.

For convenience, the Makefile also has a ``make reduce`` target which builds a
minimal Reduce executable. If you use that option, ``make install`` installs
this executable along with the library and image files, so that you can then
run Reduce directly from the command line by just typing ``reduce``. Please
note that this is a really minimalistic Reduce frontend. It's small, easy to
build and doesn't need any support files other than the image file, but it
doesn't have any of the bells and whistles of the full Reduce version either.

If you want to install the full Reduce version, there are binary packages for
various systems available on SourceForge_. You can also build Reduce yourself
from the sources; please check the build instructions in the reduce-algebra
folder for details. (Basically, you'll need to run ``./configure --with-csl``
or ``./configure --with-psl`` and then ``make`` there. Be patient, this takes
a while.)
