One of Pure's distinguishing features as a term rewriting programming language
is that it makes the symbolic manipulation of expressions very easy and
convenient. It is thus a natural environment for hosting a full-featured
computer algebra system (CAS). Computer algebra systems are complex pieces of
software featuring advanced algorithms for simplification of algebraic
expressions, symbolic integration, equation solving and much more.
Reimplementing all these algorithms in Pure would be a major undertaking, to
say the least. A much better option is to interface to an existing CAS which
has already proven its worth to the scientific computing community, has been
tested extensively and is known to be both reliable and efficient.

This is also the approach taken by Pure's :mod:`reduce` module which
interfaces to the well-known Reduce_ system. Along with Macsyma/`Maxima`_,
Reduce is one of the oldest computer algebra systems which has been around
since the 1960s and is widely recognized as a state-of-the-art, powerful and
efficient CAS. It is free/open source software distributed under a BSD-style
license_, actively maintained on its SourceForge_ website, and implementations
exist for all major computing platforms. The :mod:`reduce` module makes the
functionality of Reduce available in Pure in a seamless way. It uses an
"embedded" version of Reduce in the form of a shared library which is easy to
build from the Reduce sources; the Installation_ section below describes how
to do this. More background information and a discussion of the interface can
be found in the `Embedding REDUCE`_ thread on the Pure mailing list.

The interface can be found in the reduce.pure module. It has two parts, a
`low-level interface`_ which consists of a handful of C entry points supplied
by the Reduce library, and a `high-level interface`_ which provides everything
that the Pure programmer needs to use Reduce from Pure. Please note that at
present this module is still experimental. But the basic functionality works,
and you're welcome to discuss the new interface on the mailing list and/or
submit bug reports and patches.

Copying
=======

pure-reduce is available under the same 2-clause BSD license_ as Reduce
itself, please see the accompanying COPYING file and the reduce.pure file for
details.

Installation
============

Get the latest source from
https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-reduce-@version@.tar.gz.

You'll need both the Reduce library (named reduce.so, reduce.dylib or
reduce.dll, depending on the system you have) and a Reduce image file
(reduce.img) to make this module work. A Makefile is included with this
package so that you can build these yourself from the Reduce sources. (In
principle, this only needs to be done once for the initial installation of
this module, but you may want to repeat this procedure every once in a while
to get the latest Reduce version.)

You can check out the latest Reduce version from its svn repository with the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

   svn co svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/reduce-algebra/code/trunk reduce-algebra

This may take a while; Reduce is a *big* package. Once it's finished, just
drop the resulting reduce-algebra directory into the pure-reduce source
directory. Run ``make`` and then (if needed) ``make install`` in the
pure-reduce directory (*not* in the reduce-algebra directory!). You should
also run ``make check`` which performs a few tests in order to verify that the
interface works ok (this can be done without installing the package, but needs
the Reduce image and library).

.. note:: On some 64 bit systems (this has been reported for Debian-based
   systems), you may have to install the libc6-dev-i386 package or similar to
   make the compile go through; the CSL Makefiles included in the Reduce
   sources require this for some reason.

Also note that the pure-reduce module requires neither a full Reduce
installation nor a full build of the Reduce package; just the Reduce library
and image. Thus the additional items discussed below are all completely
optional.

For convenience, the Makefile also has a ``make reduce`` target which builds a
minimal Reduce executable. If you use that option, ``make install`` installs
this executable along with the library and image files, so that you can then
run Reduce directly from the command line by just typing ``reduce``. Please
note that this is a really minimalistic Reduce frontend. It's small, easy to
build and doesn't need any support files other than the image file, but it
doesn't have any of the bells and whistles of the full Reduce version either.

If you want to install the full Reduce version, there are binary packages for
various systems available on SourceForge_. You can also build Reduce yourself
from the sources; please check the build instructions in the reduce-algebra
folder for details. (Basically, you'll need to run ``./configure --with-csl``
or ``./configure --with-psl`` and then ``make`` there. Be patient, this takes
a while.)
