This is a module providing access to the REDUCE_ computer algebra system from
Pure. It is based on the `PROC interface`_ (a "procedural" interface to embed
REDUCE as a C library). More background information and a discussion of the
interface can be found in the `Embedding REDUCE`_ thread on the Pure mailing
list.

.. _Embedding REDUCE: http://groups.google.com/group/pure-lang/browse_thread/thread/c11e82ca2e9e8cbb

The interface can be found in reduce.pure (in particular, have a look at the
"high-level interface" at the end of the module), some basic examples are in
reduce_examp.pure. Please note that at present, this module is still highly
experimental and under heavy development. But the basic functionality appears
to work, and you're welcome to discuss the new interface on the mailing list
and/or submit bug reports and patches.

Installation
============

Get the latest source from
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-reduce-@version@.tar.gz.

You'll need the shared reduce.so (or reduce.dll) library, and a REDUCE image
file (reduce.img) to make this module work. A Makefile is included with this
package so that you can build these yourself from the REDUCE sources. (In
principle, this only needs to be done once for the initial installation of
this module, but you may want to repeat this procedure every once in a while
to get the latest REDUCE version.)

Check out the latest REDUCE version from its svn repository with the following
command:

.. code-block: console

   svn co https://reduce-algebra.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/reduce-algebra/trunk/ reduce-algebra

This may take a while; REDUCE is a *big* package. Once it's finished, just
drop the resulting reduce-algebra directory into the pure-reduce source
directory. Run ``make`` and then (if needed) ``make install`` in the
pure-reduce source directory. You should also run ``make check`` to run a few
tests in order to check that the interface works ok (this can be done without
installing the package, but needs the REDUCE image and library).

.. note:: In case the above procedure doesn't work for you, there are more
   detailed instructions by Kurt Pagani on how to compile the relevant parts
   of REDUCE, see the accompanying pure_reduce.txt file for details.
