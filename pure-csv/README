PURE-CSV - Comma Separated Value interface for the Pure programming language
======== = ===== ========= ===== ========= === === ==== =========== ========

The CSV library provides an interface to read and write comma separated value
files. The reading and writing functions are loosely based on Python's CSV
module (http://docs.python.org/lib/module-csv.html)

INSTALLATION

Run 'make' to compile the module and 'make install' (as root) to install it in
the Pure library directory. This requires GNU make.

The 'make install' step is only necessary for system-wide installation. 'make'
will try to guess your Pure installation directory, if it gets it wrong, you
can specify the installation prefix as follows: 'make install prefix=/usr'.
Make sure that you get this right, otherwise the Pure interpreter won't be
able to find the installed module.

USAGE

Data records are represented as lists of strings and numeric data. Dialects
are created using csv_dialect with a list of specifications outlined in 
csv.pure.

- csv_list (s::string, dialect)
  csv_list s::string
  
  Converts a CSV formatted string s to a list of fields according to the 
  dialect specified. If no dialect is specified, conversion is performed using
  RFC 4180 rules (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt). Invalidly formatted
  CSV causes return of a 'csv_error msg' term (see NOTES below).
  
- csv_str (x:xs)
  csv_str ((x:xs), dialect)
  
  Converts a list of fields, which includes only strings, integers, and
  doubles to a CSV formatted string according to the dialect specified. If
  no dialect is specified, conversion is performed using RFC 4180 rules
  (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt). Lists that are not strings, integers,
  or floats invoke a 'csv_error msg' term (see NOTES below).

- csv_fgets (f::pointer, dialect)
  csv_fgets f::pointer

  Is equivalent to csv_list except that reading is from file f.

- csv_fputs ((x:xs), dialect, f)
  csv_fputs ((x:xs), f)

  Is equivalent to csv_str except that writing is to file f.
  
- csv_fget (name::string, dialect)
  csv_fget name::string
  
  Reads a named file and returns a list of records. These procedures should 
  only be used on data files that are small enough to fit in the computers 
  RAM.
  
- csv_fput (name::string, recs, dialect)
  csv_fput (name::string, recs)
  
  Writes list of records to a named file. Each record is converted according
  to the rules stated in the csv_str procedure.

NOTES

- Errors in the conversion routines (input that does not abide by the
  dialect rules; records containing field types other than strings, integers
  and floats) cause a special 'csv_error msg' term to be returned, where msg
  is a string describing the particular error. To handle error conditions,
  your application should either check for these, or define csv_error to
  directly handle the error in some way (e.g., provide a default value, or
  raise an exception). For instance:

  csv_error msg = throw msg;

- MS Excel files should be written using "=""0004""" if leading 0s are 
  significant. Use the same technique if leading space is significant. Use this
  quirk only if written files are going to be imported to MS Excel.

EXAMPLES

Examples are provided in the examples subdirectory. See "readsamples.pure" for
reading csv files and "writesamples.pure" for writing.
