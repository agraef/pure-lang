PURE-CSV - Comma Separated Value interface for the Pure programming language
======== = ===== ========= ===== ========= === === ==== =========== ========

The CSV library provides an interface to read and write comma separated value
files. The reading and writing functions are loosely based on Python's CSV
module (http://docs.python.org/lib/module-csv.html)

INSTALLATION

Run 'make' to compile the module and 'make install' (as root) to install it in
the Pure library directory. This requires GNU make. The 'make install' step is
only necessary for system-wide installation.

'make' tries to guess your Pure installation directory and platform-specific
setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables manually. In
particular, 'make install prefix=/usr' sets the installation prefix, and 'make
PIC=-fPIC' or some similar flag might be needed for compilation on 64 bit
systems. Please see the Makefile for details.

USAGE

Data records are represented as lists of strings and numeric data. Dialects
are created using csv::dialect with a list of specifications outlined in 
csv.pure.

- csv::list (s::string, dialect)
  csv::list s::string
  
  Converts a CSV formatted string s to a list of fields according to the 
  dialect specified. If no dialect is specified, conversion is performed using
  RFC 4180 rules (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt). An invalidly formatted
  CSV string causes return of a 'csv::error msg' term (see NOTES below).
  
- csv::str (x:xs)
  csv::str ((x:xs), dialect)
  
  Converts a list of fields, which includes only strings, integers, and doubles
  to a CSV formatted string according to the dialect specified. If no dialect
  is specified, conversion is performed using RFC 4180 rules
  (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt). Lists that include data types other
  than strings, integers, or floats invoke a 'csv::error msg' term (see NOTES
  below).

- csv::fgets (f::pointer, dialect)
  csv::fgets f::pointer

  Is equivalent to csv::list except that reading is from file f.

- csv::fputs (x:xs) (f::pointer, dialect)
  csv::fputs (x:xs) f::pointer

  Is equivalent to csv::str except that writing is to file f.
  
- csv::fget (f::pointer, dialect)
  csv::fget f::pointer
  
  Reads a file and returns a list of records. These procedures should only be 
  used on data files that are small enough to fit in the computers RAM.
  
- csv::fput (x:xs) (f::pointer, dialect)
  csv::fput (x:xs) f::pointer
  
  Writes list of records to a file. Each record is converted according to the
  rules stated in the csv::str procedure.

NOTES

- Errors in the conversion routines (input that does not abide by the dialect
  rules; records containing field types other than strings, integers and 
  floats) cause a special 'csv::error msg' term to be returned, where msg is a
  string describing the particular error. To handle error conditions, your
  application should either check for these, or define csv::error to directly
  handle the error in some way (e.g., provide a default value, or raise an
  exception). For instance:

  csv::error msg = throw msg;

- MS Excel files should be written using "=""0004""" if leading 0s are 
  significant. Use the same technique if leading space is significant. Use this
  quirk only if written files are going to be imported to MS Excel.

EXAMPLES

Examples are provided in the examples subdirectory. See "samples.pure" for
reading and writing CSV files.
