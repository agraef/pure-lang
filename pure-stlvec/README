Installation
============

Get the latest source from
http://pure-lang.googlecode.com/files/pure-stlvec-@version@.tar.gz.
 
To install pure-stlvec (on Linux), extract the source, cd to the
pure-stlvec-@version@ directory, and run ``make``. After this you can (and
should) also run ``make test`` to run a few unit tests to make sure that
pure-stlvec works properly on your system. If ``make test`` works, run ``sudo
make install`` to install pure-stlvec on your system.  ``make`` tries to guess
your Pure installation directory and platform-specific setup. If it gets this
wrong, you can set some variables manually. In particular, ``make install
prefix=/usr`` sets the installation prefix. Please see the Makefile for
details.

Overview
========

The C++ Standard Template Library ("STL") is a library of generic containers
(data structures designed for storing other objects) and a rich set of generic
algorithms that operate on them. pure-stlvec provides an interface to one of
its most useful containers, "vector", adopted to hold pointers to Pure
expressions. The interface provides Pure programmers with a mutable container
"stlvec", that, like the STL's vector, holds a sequence of objects that can be
accessed in constant time according to their position in the sequence.

Modules
-------

The usual operations for creating, accessing and modifying stlvecs are
provided by the stlvec module. The operations are similar in name and
function to those provided by the Pure Library for other containers. As is the
case for their Pure Library counterparts, these operations are in the global
namespace.

In addition to the stlvec module, pure-stlvec provides a group of modules,
stlvec::modifying, stlvec::nonmodifying, stlvec::sort, stlvec::merge,
stlvec::heap, stlvec::minmax and stlvec::numeric, that are straight wrappers
the STL algorithms (specialized to work with STL vectors of pointers to Pure
expressions). This grouping of the STL algorithms follows that found at
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/. This web page contains a table
that summarizes of all of the algorithms in one place.

pure-stlvec provides an "umbrella" module, stlvec::algorithms, that pulls in
all of the STL algorithm interface modules in one go. The STL algorithm
wrapper functions reside in the stl namespace and have the same names as their
counterparts in the STL.

Simple Examples
---------------

Here are some examples that use the basic operations provided by the
stlvec module. ::

    > using stlvec;

    > let sv1 = stlvec (0..4); members sv1;
    [0,1,2,3,4]

    > insert (sv1,stl::svend) (5..7); members sv1;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0xaf4d2c0>
    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

    > sv1!3;
    3

    > sv1!![2,4,6];
    [2,4,6]

    > update sv1 3 33; members sv1;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0xaf4d2c0>
    [0,1,2,33,4,5,6,7]

    > erase (sv1,2,5); members sv1;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0xaf4d2c0>
    [0,1,5,6,7]

    > insert (sv1,2) [2,3,4];  members sv1;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0xaf4d2c0>
    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

     > map (+10) sv1;
    [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]

    > map (+10) (sv1,2,5);
    [12,13,14]

    > foldl (+) 0 sv1;
    28

    > [x+10 | x = sv1; x mod 2];
    [11,13,15,17]

    > {x+10 | x = (sv1,2,6); x mod 2};
    {13,15}


Here are some examples that use STL algorithms. ::

    > using stlvec::algorithms;

    > stl::reverse (sv1,2,6); members sv1;
    ()
    [0,1,5,4,3,2,6,7]

    > stl::stable_sort sv1 (>); members sv1;
    ()
    [7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]

    > stl::random_shuffle sv1; members sv1;
    ()
    [1,3,5,4,0,7,6,2]

    > stl::partition sv1 (<3); members (sv1,0,ans); members sv1;
    3
    [1,2,0]
    [1,2,0,4,5,7,6,3]

    > stl::transform sv1 (sv1,0) (*2); members sv1;
    -1
    [2,4,0,8,10,14,12,6]

    > let sv2 = emptystlvec;

    > stl::transform sv1 (sv2,stl::svback) (div 2); members sv2;
    -1
    [1,2,0,4,5,7,6,3]

Many more examples can be found in the pure-stlvec/ut directory.

Members and Sequences of Members
--------------------------------

Throughout the documentation for pure-stlvec, the member of a stlvec that is
at the nth position in the sequence of expressions stored in the stlvec is
referred to as its nth member or nth element. The nth member of a stlvec, sv,
is sometimes denoted by sv!n.  The sequence of members of sv starting at
position i up to but not including j is denoted by sv[i,j). There is a
"past-the-end" symbol, stl::svend, that denotes the position after that
occupied by the last member contained by a stlvec.

For example, if sv contains the sequence "a", "b", "c" "d" and "e", sv!0 is
"a", sv[1,3) is the sequence consisting of "b" followed by "c" and
v[3,stl::svend) denotes the sequence consisting of "d" followed by "e".

STL Iterators and Value Semantics
---------------------------------

In C++ a programmer accesses a STL container's elements by means of
"iterators", which can be thought of as pointers to the container's
elements. A single iterator can be used to access a specific element, and a
pair of iterators can be used to access a "range" of elements. By convention,
such a range includes the member pointed to by the first iterator and all
succeeding members up to but not including the member pointed to by the second
iterator. Each container has a past-the-end iterator that can be used to
specifiy ranges that include the container's last member.

In the case of vectors there is an obvious correspondence between an iterator
that points to an element and the element's position (starting at zero) in the
vector.  pure-stlvec uses this correspondence to designate a stlvec's members
in a way that makes it relatively easy to see how pure-stlvec's functions are
acting on the stlvec's underlying STL vector by referencing the STL's
documentation. Thus, if sv is a stlvec, and j is an int, "update sv j x" uses
the STL to replace the element pointed to by the iterator for position j of
sv's underlying STL vector. If, in addition, k is an int, stl::sort (sv,j,k)
(<) uses the STL to sort the elements in the range designated by the "jth" and
"kth" iterators for sv's underlying STL vector. This range, written as
sv[j,k), is the subsequence of sv that begins with the element at position j
and ends with the element at position (k-1).

Besides iterators, another cornerstone of the STL is its "value semantics",
i.e., all of the STL containers are mutable and if a container is copied, all
of its elements are copied. pure-stlvec deals with the STL's value semantics
by introducing mutable and nonmutable stlvecs, and by storing smart pointers
to objects (which have cheap copies) rather than the actual objects.

Iterator Tuples
---------------

As mentioned in the previous section, in C++ ranges are specified by a pair
of STL iterators.

In pure-stlvec ranges of elements in a stlvec are specified by "iterator
tuples" rather than, say, actual pointers to STL iterators. Iterator tuples
consist of the name of a stlvec followed by one of more ints that indicate
positions (starting from zero) of the stlvec's elements.

To illustrate how iterator tuples are used, consider the STL stable_sort
function, which sorts objects in the range [first, last) in the order imposed
by comp. Its C++ signature looks like this:

  void stable_sort ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last, Compare comp )

The corresponding pure-stlvec function, from the stlvec::sort module, looks like
this:

   stable_sort (msv, first, last) comp

where msv is a mutable stlvec, and first and last are ints. The first thing
that the Pure stable_sort does is create a pair of C++ iterators that point to
the elements in msv's underlying STL vector that occupy the positions
designated by first and last.  Next it wraps the Pure comp function in a C++
function object that, along with the two iterators, is passed to the C++
stable_sort function.

For convenience, (sv,stl::svbeg, stl::svend) can be written simply as
sv. Thus, if first were stl::svbeg (or 0), and last were stl::svend (or #msv,
the number of elements in msv), the last Pure call could be written:

   stable_sort msv comp

It should be noted that often the STL library provides a default version of
functions, which like stable_sort, use a comparator or other callback function
provided by the caller. E.g., the C++ stable_sort has a default version that
assumes the "<" operator can be used on the elements held by the container in
question:

   void stable_sort ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last)

The corresponding functions provided by the pure-stlvec modules rarely, if
ever, supply a default version. A typical example is stlvec::sort's stable_sort
which must be called with a comparator callback function:

  stable_sort msv (<);

Note also that the comparator (e.g., (<)), or other function being passed to a
pure-stlvec algorithm wrapper is almost always the last parameter. This
is the opposite of what is required for similar Pure functions, but is
consistent with the STL calling conventions.

Predefined Iterator Tuple Indexes
---------------------------------

The following integer constants are defined in the stl namespace for use
in iterator tuples.

.. namespace:: stl

.. constant:: svbeg = 0
              svend = -1 
              svback = -2

``svend`` corresponds to STL's past-end iterator for STL vectors. It makes it
possible to specify ranges that include the last element of an stlvec. I.e.,
the iterator tuple (sv,stl::svbeg,stl::svend) would specify sv[0,n), where n
is the number of elements in sv. In order to understand the purpose of
``svback``, it is necessary to understand a bit about STL's "back insert
iterators."

Back Insert Iterators
---------------------

Many of the STL algorithms insert members into a target range designated by an
iterator that points to the first member of the target range. Consistent with
raw C usage, it is ok to copy over existing elements the target
stlvec. E.g.,::

   > using stlvec::modifying;

   > let v1 = stlvec (0..2);

   > let v2 = stlvec ("a".."g");

   > stl::copy v1 (v2,2) $$ members v2;
   ["a","b",0,1,2,"f","g"]

This is great for C++ programmers, but for Pure programmers it is almost
always preferable to append the copied items to the end of a target stlvec,
rather than overwriting all or part or part of it. This can be accomplished
using stl::svback. E.g.,::

   > stl::copy v1 (v2,stl::svback) $$ members v2;
   ["a","b",0,1,2,"f","g",0,1,2]

In short, when a pure-stlvec function detects "stl::svback" in a target
iterator tuple, it constructs a STL "back inserter iterator" and passes it on
to the corresponding wrapped STL function.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation of the functions provided by the stlvec module are
reasonably complete.  In contrast, the descriptions of functions provided by
the STL algorithm modules are purposely simplified (and may not, therefore, be
technically accurate). This reflects that fact that the functions provided by
pure-stlvec have an obvious correspondence to the functions provided by the
STL, and the STL is extremely well documented. Furthermore, using the Pure
interpreter, it is very easy to simply play around with with any of the
pure-stlvec functions if there are doubts, especially with respect to "corner
cases."  Often this leads to a deeper understanding compared to reading a
precise technical description.

A good book on the STL is STL Tutorial and Reference Guide, Second Edition, by
David R. Musser, Gillmer J. Derge and Atul Saini. A summary of all of the STL
algorithms can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/.

Parameter Names
---------------

In the descriptions of functions that follow, parameter names used in
function descriptions represent specific types of Pure objects:

sv
  stlvec (mutable or immutable)

csv
  const (i.e., immutable) stlvec

msv
  mutable stlvec

x
  an arbitrary Pure expression

xs
  a list of arbitrary Pure expressions

count, sz, n
  whole numbers to indicate a number of elements, size of a vector, etc

i,j
  whole numbers used to designate indexes into a stlvec

f,m,l
  whole numbers (or stl::beg or stl::svend) designating the "first", "middle"
  or "last" iterators in a stlvec iterator tuple

p
  a whole number (or other iterator constant such as stl::svend or
  stl::svback) used in a two element iterator tuple (e.g., (sv,p))

(sv,p)
  an iterator tuple that will be mapped to an iterator that points
  to the pth position of sv's underlying STL vector, v, (or to a
  back iterator on v if p is stl::svback)

(sv,f,l)
  an iterator tuple that will be mapped to the pair of iterators
  that are designated by (sv,f) and (sv,l)

(sv,f,m,l)
  an iterator tuple that will be mapped to the iterators that
  are designated by (sv,f), (sv,m) and (sv,l)

sv[f,l) 
  the range of members beginning with that at (sv,f) up to but not
  including that at (con,l)

comp
  a function that accepts two objects and returns true if the
  first argument is less than the second (in the strict
  weak ordering defined by comp), and false otherwise

unary_pred

unary_fun
  a function that accepts one objects and returns another

bin_fun

gen_fun
  a function of one parameter that produces a sequence of objects, one
  for each call

For readability, and to correspond with the STL documentation, the words
"first", "middle", and "last", or variants such as "first1" are often used
instead of f,m,l.

Error Handling
==============

The functions provided this module handle errors by throwing exceptions.

Exception Symbols
-----------------

.. namespace:: ::

.. constructor:: bad_argument

   This exception is thrown when a function is passed an unexpected value. A
   subtle error to watch for is a malformed iterator tuple (e.g., one with
   the wrong number of elements).

.. constructor:: bad_function

   This exception is thrown when a purported Pure call-back function is not
   even callable.

.. constructor:: failed_cond

   This exception is thrown when a Pure call-back predicate returns a value
   that is not an int.

.. constructor:: out_of_bounds

   This exception is thrown if the specified index is out of bounds.

.. constructor:: range_overflow                 
 
   This exception is thrown by functions that write over part of a target
   stlvec (e.g., copy) when the target range too small to accommodate the
   result.

.. constructor:: range_overlap 

   This exception is thrown by algorithm functions that write over part of a
   target stlvec when the target and source ranges overlap in a way that is
   not allowed.

In addition, any exception thrown by a Pure callback function passed to a
pure-stlvec function will be caught and be rethrown by the pure-stlvec
function.

Examples
--------

::

    > using stlvec, stlvec::modifying;

    > let sv1 = stlvec (0..4); members sv1;
    [0,1,2,3,4]

    > let sv2 = stlvec ("a".."e"); members sv2;
    ["a","b","c","d","e"]

    > sv1!10;
    <stdin>, line 25: unhandled exception 'out_of_bounds' ...

    > stl::copy sv1 (sv2,10);
    <stdin>, line 26: unhandled exception 'out_of_bounds' ...

    > stl::copy sv1 (sv2,2,3); // sb (sv2,pos)
    <stdin>, line 22: unhandled exception 'bad_argument' ...

    > stl::copy sv1 (sv2,2);
    <stdin>, line 23: unhandled exception 'range_overflow' ...

    > stl::copy sv2 (sv2,2);
    <stdin>, line 24: unhandled exception 'range_overlap' ...

    > stl::copy (sv1,1,3) (sv2,0); members sv2; // ok
    2
    [1,2,"c","d","e"]

    > stl::sort sv2 (>); // apples and oranges 
    <stdin>, line 31: unhandled exception 'failed_cond'

    > listmap (\x->throw DOA) sv1; // callback function throws exception
    <stdin>, line 34: unhandled exception 'DOA' ...

Basic Operations
================

The stlvec module provides functions for creating, accessing and modifying
stlvecs. They are all in the global namespace.

Imports
-------

To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
to your program::

  using stlvec;

Data Structure
--------------

Currently, stlvecs are of the form (STLVEC x) or (CONST_STLVEC x), where x is
a pointer to the underlying STL vector. E.g.::

   > let v1 = stlvec (0..3); v1;
   STLVEC #<pointer 0x915c8e0>

   > members v1;
   [0,1,2,3]

   > let v2 = stlconst $ stlvec (0..3); v2;
   CONST_STLVEC #<pointer 0x8c1dbf0>

This representation may change in the future, and must not be relied upon
by client modules. In particular, one must never attempt to use the
embedded pointer directly.

Functions that modify a stlvec will simply fail unless the stlvec is
mutable::

   > update v2 0 100;
   update (CONST_STLVEC #<pointer 0x9f07690>) 0 100

Types
-----

Three type tags are provided for stlvecs:

.. type:: mutable_stlvec /type

   The type for a mutable stlvec. The stlvec must have been constructed with
   STLVEC.

.. type:: const_stlvec /type

   The type for an immutable stlvec. The stlvec must have been constructed
   with CONST_STLVEC.

.. type:: stlvec /type

   The type for a stlvec, mutable or immutable. The stvec can be constructed
   with STLVEC or CONST_STLVEC.

In addition there are two type tags for stlvec iterator tuples:

.. type:: svit /type

   The type for an iterator tuple. The underlying stlvec can be mutable
   or immutable.

.. type:: mutable_svit /type

   The type for an iterator tuple whose underlying stlvec is  mutable.
 

Support for Copy-On-Write Semantics
-----------------------------------

The functions that create new stlvecs (emptystlvec, stlvec, and mkstlvec) all
return mutable stlvecs. For those that prefer immutable data structures,
stlvecs can be converted to immutable stlvecs (usually after they have been
created and modified within a function) by the ``stlconst`` function. This
function converts a mutable stlvec to an immutable stlvec without changing the
underlying STL vector.

Using a copy-on-write strategy it is possible to use stlvecs in a manner that
is consistent with functional programming.  Typically, a function that
"updates" a stlvec passed to it as an argument will copy the input stlvec to a
new locally scoped mutable stlvec, modify the new stlvec and use stlconst to
make the new stlvec immutable before it is returned. It should be noted that
several of the STL algorithms have "copy" versions which place their results
directly into a new stlvec, which can eliminate the need to copy the input
stlvec. E.g.::

    > let sv1 = stlvec ("a".."e");

    > let sv2 = emptystlvec;

    > stl::reverse_copy sv1 (sv2,stl::svback) $$ members sv2;
    ["e","d","c","b","a"]

Without reverse_copy, one have to copy sv1 into sv2 and then reverse sv2.

Operations
----------

When reading the function descriptions that follow, please bear in mind
that whenever a function is passed an iterator tuple of the form (sv,first,
last), first and last can be dropped, leaving (sv), or simply sv. The
function will treat the "unary" iterator tuple (sv) as (sv, stl::svbeg,
stl::svend).

.. function:: emptystlvec

   return an empty stlvec

.. function:: stlvec (sv,first,last)

   create a new stlvec consisting of the elements in sv[first,last)

.. function:: stlvec xs

   create a new stlvec from a list of values

.. function:: mkstlvec x count

   create a new stlvec consisting of count x's.

.. function:: stlconst sv

   create an immutable stlvec that shares the same underlying STL vector
   with sv

.. function:: prefix #  sv

   return the number or elements in sv

.. function:: size (sv,first,last)

   returns the number of elements in sv[first,last)

.. function:: bounds (sv,first,last)

   returns the pair (i,j) where i is first and j is last except that
   stl::begin is converted to 0 and stl::svend is converted to #sv

.. function:: reserve msv count

   modify the underlying STL vector to have at least count slots, useful for
   packing data into a fixed size vector and possibly to speed up the addition
   of new members

.. function:: capacity sv

   return the total amount of slots held by the underlying STL vector

.. function:: null sv

   test whether sv is empty

.. function:: infix ! sv i

   return the i\th member of sv

.. function:: first sv
              last sv

   first and last member of sv

.. function:: members (sv, first, last)

   return a list of values stored in sv[first,last)

.. function:: update msv i x

   replace the i\ th member of msv by x and return msv

.. function:: append sv x

   append x to the end of sv

.. function:: insert (msv,p) xs
              insert (msv,p) (sv,first,last)

   insert members of the list xs or the range sv[first, last)
   into msv, all preceding the pth member of msv. Members are shifted
   to make room for the inserted members

.. function:: rmfirst msv
              rmlast msv

   remove first and last member from msv

.. function:: erase (msv,first,last)
              erase (msv,p)
              erase msv

   remove msv[first,last) from msv, remove msv!p from msv, or make msv
   empty. Members are shifted to occupy vacated slots

.. function:: clear msv

   remove all of msv's members

.. function:: all_equal comp (sv1, first1, last1) (sv2, first2, last2)

   returns true if comp returns true for all corresponding members of
   sv1[first1, last1) and sv1[first1, last1)

.. function:: infix == sv1 sv2
              infix ~= sv1 sv2

   (x == y) is the same as equal (==) x y. (x ~= y is simply ~(equal (==) x
   y)

Note that ``==`` and ``~==`` are not defined for iterator tuples (the rules
would never be executed because == is defined on tuples in the Prelude)

String Representation
---------------------

The stlvec module provides tostr, a function for producing string
representations stlvec that can be helpful for debugging and other purposes.

.. function:: tostr (max_sz,sep) (sv,first,last)

   returns a string representation of the range sv[first,last) where max_sz is
   the maximum number of elements to print. If max_sz <= 0 tostr uses max_sz
   of 100. sep, an optional parameter with default value "," is inserted after
   each element.

Here are some examples::

   > let x = stlvec (1..10);

   > tostr 0 x;
   "sv{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}"

   > tostr 3 x;
   "sv{1,2,3,...}"

   > tostr 0 (x,1,7);
   "sv{ 2,3,4,5,6,7 }" 

   > tostr 3 (x,2,7);
   "sv{ 3,4,5,... }"

   > puts $ tostr (3,",\n   ") (x,0,4);
   sv{1,
      2,
      3,
      ... }

The tostr function can be used with __show__. E.g.,::

   > __show__ it::svit = tostr 5 it;

   > x;
   sv{1,2,3,4,5,...}

   > (stlconst x);
   csv{1,2,3,4,5,...}


Convenience Functions
---------------------

The stlvec module provides convenience functions that apply map, catmap,
foldl, etc, to directly access Pure expressions stored in a stlvec.

.. function:: map /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of map unary_fun $ members (sv, first,
   last)

.. function:: listmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

   same as map, used in list comprehensions

.. function:: catmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of catmap unary_fun $ members (sv, first,
   last)

.. function:: do /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of do unary_fun $ members (sv, first,
   last)

.. function:: foldl /stlvec bin_fun x (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of foldl bin_fun x $ members (sv,
   first, last)

.. function:: foldl1 /stlvec bin_fun (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of foldl1 bin_fun $ members (sv, first,
   last)

.. function:: filter /stlvec unary_pred (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of filter unary_pred $ members (sv, first,
   last)

The following four functions map (or catmap) stlvecs onto row and col
matrixes, primarily for use in matrix comprehensions.

.. function:: rowmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

.. function:: rowcatmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

.. function:: colmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

.. function:: colcatmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

Please note that "stlvec to stlvec" functions are provided by the pure-stl
algorithm modules. Thus, for example, the stlvec module does not provide a
function that maps one stlvec onto a new stlvec. That functionality, and more,
is provided by stl::transform, which can be found in the stlvec::modifying
module.

Examples
--------

See ut_stvec in the pure-stlvec/ut directory.

STL Nonmodifying Algorithms
===========================

The stlvec::nonmodifying module provides an interface to the STL's
non-modifying sequence operations.

Imports
-------

To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
to your program::

  using stlvec::nonmodifying;

All of the functions are in the stl namespace.

STL Sort Algorithms
===================

The stlvec::sort module provides an interface to the STL's sorting and binary
search algorithms.

Imports
-------

To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
to your program::

  using stlvec::sort;

All of the functions are in the stl namespace.

Operations
----------

All of the functions in this module require the caller to supply an ordering
function, comp (as for the Pure library sort function). The functions (<) and
(>) are commonly passed as comp.

.. function:: sort (msv, first, last) comp

   sorts msv[first, last)

.. function:: stable_sort (msv, first, last) comp

   sorts msv[first, last), preserving the relative order of equal
   members

.. function:: partial_sort (msv, first, middle, last) comp

   fills msv[first, middle) with the elements of msv[first,last) that would
   appear there if msv[first,last) were sorted using comp and fills
   msv[middle,last) with the remaining elements in unspecified order

.. function:: partial_sort_copy (sv, first1, last1) (msv, first2, last2) comp

   let n be the number of elements in sv[first1, last1) and r be the number of
   elements in msv[first2, last2). If r < n, :func:`partial_sort_copy` fills
   msv[first2, last2) with the first r elements of what sv[first1, last1)
   would be if it had been sorted. If r >= n, it fills msv[first2, first2+n)
   with the elements of sv[first1, last1) in sorted order. sv[first1,last1) is
   unchanged

.. function:: nth_element (msv, first, middle, last) comp

   rearranges the elements of msv[first, last) as follows. Let n be middle -
   first, and let x be the nth smallest element of msv[first, last). After the
   function is called, sv!middle will be x. All of the elements of msv[first,
   middle) will be less than x and all of the elements of msv[middle+1, last)
   will be greater than x

The next four functions assume that sv[first, last) is ordered by comp.

.. function:: lower_bound (sv, first, last) x comp

   returns an int designating the first position into which x can be inserted
   into sv[first, last) while maintaining the sorted ordering

.. function:: upper_bound (sv, first, last) x comp

   returns an int designating the last position into which x can be inserted
   into sv[first, last) while maintaining the sorted ordering

.. function:: equal_range (sv, first, last) x comp

   returns a pair of ints, (lower, upper) where lower and upper would have
   been returned by separate calls to lower_bound and upper_bound.

.. function:: binary_search (sv, first, last) x comp

   returns true if x is an element of sv[first, last)

Examples
--------

See ut_sort.pure in the pure-stlvec/ut directory.


STL Merge Algorithms
====================

The stlvec::merge module provides an interface to the STL's merge
algorithms. These algorithms operate on sorted ranges.

Imports
-------

To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
to your program::

  using stlvec::merge;

All of the functions are in the stl namespace.

Operations
----------

All of the functions in this module require the caller to supply an ordering
functions, comp (as for the Pure library sort function). They only work
properly on input ranges that have been previously sorted using comp. The set
operations generally do not check for range overflow because it is not
generally possible to determine the length of the result of a set operation
until after it is completed. In most cases you will get a nasty segmentation
fault if the result is bigger than the target range. The best way to avoid
this possibility it to use a back iterator to specifify the target range.

See parameter naming conventions at ..

.. function:: merge (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) (msv,p) comp

   merges the two sorted ranges into the sorted range msv[p,p+n) where n is
   the total length of the merged sequence

   places the sorted union of sv1[first1,last1) and
   sv2[first2,last2) into msv[p,p+n) where n is the number
   of elements in the sorted union, and returns the past-the-end position of
   the sorted union

.. function:: set_intersection (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) (msv,p) comp

   places the sorted intersection of sv1[first1,last1) and sv2[first2,last2)
   into msv[p,p+n) where n is the number of elements in the sorted
   intersection, and returns p+n (or stl::svend, if applicable)

.. function:: set_difference (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) (msv,p) comp

   places the sorted difference of sv1[first1,last1) and sv2[first2,last2)
   into msv[p,p+n) where n is the number of elements in the sorted difference,
   and returns p+n (or stl::svend, if applicable)

.. function:: set_symmetric_difference (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) (msv,p) comp

   places the sorted symmetric_difference of sv1[first1,last1) and
   sv2[first2,last2) into msv[p,p+n) where n is the number of elements in the
   sorted symmetric_difference, and returns returns p+n (or stl::svend, if
   applicable)

STL Heap Algorithms
===================

The stlvec::heap module provides an interface to the STL's heap operations.

functions, comp (as for the Pure library sort function). The functions (<)
and (>) are commonly passed as comp.

.. function:: make_heap (msv,first,last) comp

   rearranges the elements of msv[first,last) so that they are a
   heap, i.e., after this msv!first will be the largest element in
   msv[first,last), and push_heap and pop_heap will work properly

.. function:: push_heap (msv,first,last) comp

    makes msv[first,last) a heap (assuming that msv[first,last-1) was a heap)

.. function:: pop_heap (msv,first,last) comp

   swaps msv!first with msv!(last-1), and makes msv[first,last-1) a heap
   (assuming that msv[first,last) was a heap)

   sorts the elements in msv[first,last)

Examples

algorithms.

Imports
-------

To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
to your program::

  using stlvec::minmax;

   returns the position of the minimal element of sv[first,last) under the
   ordering defined by comp

.. function:: max_element (sv,first,last) comp

   returns the position of the maximal element of sv[first,last) under the
   ordering defined by comp

.. function:: lexicographical_compare (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) comp

   compares sv1[first1,last1) and sv2[first2,last2) element by element
   according to the ordering defined by comp, and returns true if the first
   sequence is less than the second

Algorithms are provided for stepping through all the permutations the elements
of a stlvec. For these purposes, the first permutation has the elements of
msv[first,last) sorted in ascending order and the last has the elements sorted
in descending order.

.. function:: next_permutation (msv,first,last) comp

   rearranges msv[first,last) to produce the next permutation, in
   the ordering imposed by comp. If msv[first,last) is not the

.. function:: partial_sum (sv,first,last) (msv, p) bin_fun

   accumulate bin_fun f over the elements of sv1[first1,last1), placing
   itermediate results in msv[p,p+n), where n is last - first, and returns q
   where m is q - n and msv[m,q) is the intermediate sequence

.. function:: adjacent_difference (sv,first,last) (msv, p) bin_fun

   produce a sequence of new elements by applying bin_fun to adjacent elements
   of sv[first,last), placing the new elements in msv[p,p+n), where n is last
   - first, with the intermediate results, and returns q where m is q - n and
   msv[m,q) is the new sequence

Examples
--------

See ut_numeric.pure in the pure-stlvec/ut directory.

Trace Mode
==========

If the pure-stlvec dlls are built using 'make debug' (as opposed to 'make',
'make all' or 'make dlls'), the pure-stlvec tracing functions will be
enabled. These functions, all of which are defined in the stl namespace, can
be used to trace the creation and deletion of stlvecs as well as the changes
in ref counts that occur as Pure objects are moved and copied. In addition to
being useful for maintaining the pure-stlvec modules, these functions can be
used to observe the STL copy semantics.

.. function:: set_sv_trace on_off::int

   enables or disables tracing the creation and deletion of stlvecs

.. function:: sv_trace_enabled

   returns 1 if stlvec tracing is enabled, else 0

.. function:: set_px_trace on_off::int

   enables or disables tracing 'copying' of Pure expressions

.. function:: px_trace_enabled

   returns 1 if Pure expression tracing is enabled, else 0

In addition, the following function, also in the stl namespace, is available
whether or not debug is passed to make.

.. function:: refc x

   returns the x's reference count (maintained by the Pure runtime for
   garbage collection purposes)
