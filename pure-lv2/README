distribution for details.

Installation
============

Get the latest source from
https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang/downloads/pure-lv2-@version@.tar.gz.

Make sure that you have the latest Pure version installed. (At the time of
this writing, the latest Pure source from hg is needed.)

Run ``make`` to compile and ``sudo make install`` to install the module. This
installs the lv2.pure module and the source of the LV2 plugin wrapper
(lv2pure.c, lv2pure.h) in the Pure library directory, and the pure2lv2 script
in the bin directory, under the same installation prefix as the Pure
interpreter. To uninstall the module, use ``sudo make uninstall``. There are a
number of other targets (mostly for maintainers), please see the Makefile for
details.

``make`` tries to guess your Pure installation directory and platform-specific
setup. If it gets this wrong, you can set some variables manually, please see
the Makefile for details.

Description
===========

LV2_ is the new Linux audio plugin standard (successor of the venerable
LADSPA_ standard) which aims to be portable and extensible. LV2 plugins can
process any combination of audio, MIDI and control data in order to implement
various kinds of real-time signal processing modules for use in digital audio
and MIDI software such as Ardour_ and Qtractor_.  A companion module is
available which lets you implement LV2 plugin hosts in Pure, see
:doc:`pure-lilv`. Support for Miller Puckette's graphical computer music and
multimedia software Pd_ is available through the author's `lv2plugin~`_
external. Moreover, stand-alone LV2 hosts such as jalv_ can be used to
interface with other software which doesn't support LV2 directly, via the
`Jack audio connection kit`_.

This package provides a generic LV2 plugin wrapper for Pure which can be
linked with batch-compiled Pure scripts to obtain LV2 plugin modules. For
convenience, a shell script named pure2lv2 is included, which lets you compile
the plugin and turn it into a complete LV2 bundle (consisting of an LV2 plugin
manifest and the plugin binary), ready to be loaded by any LV2 host. The
package also includes an lv2.pure module which provides the operations needed
to implement the functionality of a plugin, such as functions to read and
write LV2 port data in Pure.

Our implementation supports all standard LV2 port types (including MIDI via
LV2 atom ports) and should thus be able to work with most LV2 hosts right out
of the box. Experimental support for the LV2 time extension is also available,
so that MIDI plugins written in Pure can obtain musical time and position data
if the host supports this; please check lv2.pure for details. The package
includes several examples which demonstrate how to write LV2 plugins of
various kinds in Pure, specifically:

* pure_amp.pure shows how to do basic audio and control processing in order to
  amplify an incoming audio signal.

* pure_transp.pure demonstrates how to implement a simple MIDI processing
  module which transposes incoming MIDI notes.

* pure_metro.pure shows how to implement a MIDI metronome by making use of the
  musical time and tempo data provided by the LV2 time extension (this
  currently requires Ardour to work).

Please also check the Usage_ section below for information on how to run the
pure2lv2 script.

Requirements and Limitations
============================

Our implementation uses LV2's `dynamic manifests`_, so that the plugin
manifest, which describes the ports and other properties of the plugin, can be
included in the plugin module. This makes things easier, but requires an LV2
host which supports the dynamic manifest extension (most LV2 hosts nowadays
do; this includes all the hosts we mentioned above).

.. _dynamic manifests: http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/dynmanifest/

As the Pure runtime isn't thread-safe yet, our implementation effectively
serializes the plugin callbacks (invocations of the ``plugin`` function)
across *all* Pure plugins running inside a host. While this won't make a
difference for single-threaded LV2 hosts such as jalv and Pd, it also makes
the Pure plugins work reliably in heavily multi-threaded hosts such as Ardour.
However, the serialization of callbacks may become a major bottleneck if a
multi-threaded host runs many Pure plugins concurrently on a multi-processor
machine. At present there is no way around this, but hopefully this limitation
will go away in the not-too-distant future when the Pure runtime becomes
thread-safe.

Usage
=====

A summary of the command syntax and options of the pure2lv2 script can be
printed with ``purelv2 -h``. Usually the script is invoked simply as
``pure2lv2 myplugin.pure``, where ``myplugin.pure`` is the Pure script
implementing the plugin. The plugin script must provide two functions in order
to implement the functionality of the plugin:

* The ``manifest`` function returns the port descriptions from which the
  plugin manifest is created when the LV2 host performs plugin discovery. This
  may be implemented either as a parameter-less function or a global variable
  in the Pure script. In either case it should return the list of port
  descriptions in a format described in the lv2.pure module.

* The ``plugin`` function implements the plugin itself. It gets invoked with a
  pointer object representing the plugin data which can be passed to the
  operations in the lv2.pure module. Often the plugin will actually be
  implemented as a closure which also encapsulates the local state maintained
  by the plugin; please check the included examples for details. At runtime,
  the ``plugin`` function gets invoked repeatedly with an additional
  parameter, either a truth value denoting a change in the activation status,
  or the value ``()`` to indicate that a block of samples (and/or MIDI
  messages and control data) is to be processed.

Please check the included examples to get an idea how the plugin scripts look
like. Here is a simple example (an abridged version of pure_amp.pure) which
multiplies an incoming audio signal with a volume control::

  using lv2;

  manifest = [("vol", "Volume", lv2::controlin, 0.5, 0.0, 1.0),
              ("audioin", lv2::audioin), ("audioout", lv2::audioout)];

  plugin self () = () when
    // Process a block of samples.
    vol = lv2::get_port self 0; // control value from port #0 (control input)
    wav = lv2::get_port self 1; // sample data from port #1 (audio input)
    // Multiply the sample data with the vol control value and output the
    // resulting wave on port #2 (audio output).
    lv2::set_port self 2 (map (*vol) wav);
  end;

Running ``pure2lv2 myplugin.pure`` turns the plugin script into an LV2 bundle,
which will be written to ``myplugin.lv2`` by default (i.e., using the same
basename as the plugin script). You can also specify a different name and path
for the bundle directory with the ``-o`` (or ``--output``) option, and a
custom URI prefix for the bundle with the ``-u`` (or ``--uriprefix``) option.
Before you can use the plugin with your LV2 hosts, you still have to move the
bundle directory to a directory on your ``LV2_PATH`` (unless you already
specified a suitable target path with ``-o``). The examples folder in the
source package contains a GNU Makefile which shows how to automate this
process.

Normally the Pure code of the plugin will be compiled to a native object file
which gets linked directly into the plugin binary. However, there's also a
``-s`` (or ``--script``) option which copies the source script (along with any
additional source files specified after the plugin script on the command line)
to the bundle directory instead, from where it will be loaded dynamically when
the plugin is used. This increases load times, sometimes substantially, since
the Pure interpreter will have to JIT-compile the Pure script every time the
host starts up and loads the plugins. But it also reduces turnaround times
since you can easily change the plugin script right inside the bundle, without
having to run pure2lv2 in between; this may be convenient when developing and
testing a plugin.

.. Enjoy!
