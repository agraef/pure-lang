/* The hashmap type. Hashmaps are simply pointers to STL hashed maps
   (unordered_map) which hold key-value associations where both keys and
   values may be arbitrary Pure expressions. Memory management is automatic.

   NOTES:

   - Keys in a hashmap may be stored in an apparently random order (not
     necessarily the order in which they were inserted).

   - Hashmaps are *mutable*. Inserting a key into a hashmap or deleting it
     modifies the underlying STL data structure as a side effect of the
     operation. If you need value semantics, you should use one of the dict or
     set data structures from the standard library instead. (Another
     possibility is to take a copy of a hashmap if you need to preserve the
     original value, but note that this operation takes O(n) time.)

   - Since hashmaps are pointers, two hashmaps are syntactically equal iff
     they are exactly the same object (identical pointer values). This test
     can be done in constant time. Use the semantic equality tests below if
     you need to test whether two hashmaps contain the same elements. */
