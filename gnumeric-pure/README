Gnumeric/Pure is a Gnumeric_ extension which lets you use Pure_ functions in
Gnumeric, the Gnome spreadsheet. It offers better execution speed than the
existing Perl and Python plugins, and provides some powerful features not
found in other Gnumeric scripting plugins, such as asynchronous data sources
created from Pure streams and OpenGL rendering in Gnumeric frame widgets via
Pure's OpenGL module.

Introduction
============

This package provides a Gnumeric_ extension which gives you access to the
Pure_ programming language in Gnumeric. It works pretty much like the Perl and
Python plugin loaders which are distributed with Gnumeric, but Gnumeric/Pure
offers some powerful features which aren't found in other Gnumeric scripting
plugins:

* Pure is a functional programming language which fits the computational model
  of spreadsheet programs very well.

* Pure is based on term rewriting and thus enables you to do symbolic
  computations in addition to the usual numeric calculations.

* Pure has a built-in MATLAB_/Octave_-like matrix data structure which makes
  it easy to deal with cell ranges in a spreadsheet in an efficient manner.

* Gnumeric/Pure offers support for rendering OpenGL_ scenes in Gnumeric frame
  widgets, via Pure's own OpenGL interface.

* Pure also has built-in support for lazy data structures and thus allows you
  to handle potentially infinite amounts of data such as the list of all prime
  numbers. Gnumeric/Pure lets you turn such lazy values into asynchronous data
  sources computed in the background, which update the spreadsheet
  automatically as results become available.

* Last but not least, Pure is compiled to native code on the fly. This means
  that, while startup times are a bit longer due to Pure's JIT compiler
  kicking in (you'll notice this if you open a spreadsheet with Pure
  functions), the resulting compiled code then typically executes *much*
  faster than equivalent interpreted Perl and Python code.

Adding Pure functions to Gnumeric is quite easy. Once the plugin is installed
and enabled, you can simply start adding Pure functions to the provided
``pure_func.pure`` script, or you can create your own Pure plugin folders.
Gnumeric/Pure also provides a programming interface for use in Pure which
gives you access to various advanced features, such as modifying entire ranges
of cells with one Pure call, calling Gnumeric functions from Pure, and setting
up asynchronous data sources and OpenGL frames. This is all explained in
detail below.

Installation
============

Obviously, you need to have both Pure and Gnumeric installed. Pure 0.35 and
Gnumeric 1.19.13 are known to work. We recommend Gnumeric 1.19.14 (only
available in the Gnumeric git repository at the time of this writing) since it
has improved support for GUI widgets. (Older Gnumeric versions probably work
as well if you're willing to fiddle with the Makefile and/or the sources. See
the beginning of the Makefile for related information.)

As shipped, the Makefile is set up to build Gnumeric/Pure with OpenGL support,
which requires that you have the OpenGL libraries as well as GtkGLExt_ (the
Gtk OpenGL extension) installed. These should be readily available on most
systems, but you can also disable this feature by invoking ``make`` as ``make
GLDEPS=``.

.. _GtkGLExt: http://gtkglext.sourceforge.net

Run ``make`` to compile the software. You might have to adjust the settings at
the beginning of the Makefile to make this work. If you're lucky and the
compile goes through, you should now have a ``pure_loader.so`` file in the
``pure-loader`` subdirectory. You can install the plugin and related stuff
with ``sudo make install`` in the global Gnumeric plugin directory, or if you
prefer to install it into your personal plugin directory then run ``make
install-local`` instead.  (We recommend the latter since it lets you adjust
``pure_func.pure`` for your purposes more easily.) Optionally, you might also
want to copy the ``gnumeric-pure.html`` file to your Pure library directory so
that you can read it with the ``help`` command of the Pure interpreter or in
Emacs Pure mode.

Typically, ``make install`` and ``make install-local`` will install the
plugins into the following directories by default:

* System-wide installations go into ``/usr/local/gnumeric/1.9.13/plugins`` or
  similar, depending on where Gnumeric is installed.

* User-specific installations go into ``~/.gnumeric/1.9.13/plugins``.

The Makefile tries to guess the installation path and version number of
Gnumeric on its own. If it guesses wrong, you can change these using the
Makefile variables ``prefix`` and ``gnmversion``, respectively. For instance::

  $ make prefix=/usr gnmversion=1.9.13

If ``make install`` doesn't work for some reason, you can also just copy the
``pure-func``, ``pure-glfunc`` and ``pure-loader`` directories manually to
your Gnumeric plugin directory.

Setup
=====

Once Gnumeric/Pure has been properly installed, you should see it in
Gnumeric's Tools/Plug-ins dialog. There are actually two main entries, one
labelled "Pure functions" and the other one labelled "Pure plugin loader". You
need to enable both before you can start using Pure functions in your Gnumeric
spreadsheets. There's also a third entry labelled "Pure OpenGL functions"
which you might want to enable if you want to try the OpenGL capabilities
(this will only work if you built Gnumeric/Pure with OpenGL support and have
Pure's OpenGL module installed; see `OpenGL Interface`_ for details).

Gnumeric doesn't provide much in the way of GUI customization options right
now, but at least it's possible for plugins to install and configure
additional menu and toolbar options. Gnumeric/Pure adds three additional
options to the Tools menu which allow you to stop asynchronous data sources,
reload Pure scripts and edit them. After installation, the definitions of
these items can be found in the ``pure-loader/pure-ui.xml`` file in your
Gnumeric plugin directory. Have a look at this file and edit is as
desired. E.g., if you want to put the Pure-related options into a submenu and
enable toolbar buttons for these options, then your ``pure-ui.xml`` file
should look as follows::

  <ui>
    <menubar>
      <menu name="Tools" action="MenuTools">
        <separator/>
        <menu name="Pure" action="PureMenu">
          <menuitem action="PureStop"/>
          <menuitem action="PureReload"/>
          <menuitem action="PureEdit"/>
        </menu>
      </menu>
    </menubar>
    <toolbar name="StandardToolbar">
      <separator/>
      <toolitem action="PureStop"/>
      <toolitem action="PureReload"/>
      <toolitem action="PureEdit"/>
    </toolbar>
  </ui>

Basic Usage
===========

With Pure/Gnumeric installed and enabled, you should be ready to join the fun
now. Start up Gnumeric, click on a cell and invoke the "f(x)" dialog. The Pure
functions available for use are shown in the "Pure" category. E.g., click on
``pure_hello``. Now the Pure interpreter will be loaded and the function
description displayed. Click "Insert" and then "Ok". You should now be able to
read the friendly greeting returned by the ``pure_hello`` function.

Of course, you can also enter the function call directly as a formula into a
cell as usual. Click on a cell, then enter the following::

  =pure_hello(getenv("USER"))

The greeting should now be displayed with your login name in it.

Play around a bit with the other Pure functions. These functions are nothing
special; they are just ordinary Pure functions which are defined by the
``pure_func.pure`` script in the ``pure-func`` subdirectory of your Gnumeric
plugin directory. You can have a look at them by invoking the "Edit Pure
Script" option which gets added to the Tools/Pure menu once the Pure plugin
loader is enabled. (This will invoke the emacs editor by default, or the
editor named by the ``EDITOR`` environment variable. You can set this
environment variable in your shell's startup files.) The Tools/Pure menu
contains a second Pure-related option, "Reload Pure Scripts" which can be used
to quickly reload all loaded Pure scripts after edits; more about that later.

Please note that most of the functions in ``pure_func.pure`` are rather
useless, they are only provided for illustrative purposes. However, there are
some useful examples in there, too, in particular:

* ``pure_eval`` lets you evaluate any Pure expression, given as a string in
  its first argument. E.g., try something like ``=pure_eval("foldl (+) 0
  (1..100)")``. Additional parameters are accessible as ``x!0``, ``x!1``,
  etc. For instance: ``=pure_eval("x!0+x!1",A1,B1)``.

* ``pure_echo`` just displays its arguments as a string in Pure syntax, as the
  interpreter sees them. This is useful for debugging purposes. E.g.,
  ``=pure_echo(A1:B10)`` shows the given range as a Pure matrix.

* ``pure_shell`` is a variation of ``pure_eval`` which executes arbitrary Pure
  code and returns the last evaluated expression (if any) as a string. This is
  mainly provided as a convenience to create an "interactive Pure shell" which
  lets you evaluate Pure code inside Gnumeric. To these ends, simply prepare a
  text cell for entering the code to be evaluated, and then apply
  ``pure_shell`` on this text cell in another cell to display the result.

A spreadsheet showing most of the predefined functions in action can be found
in ``pure-examples.gnumeric`` example distributed with Gnumeric/Pure.

Interactive Pure Shell
======================

The ``pure-examples.gnumeric`` spreadsheet also includes an instance of
``pure_shell`` which lets you evaluate arbitrary Pure code in the same
interpreter instance that executes Gnumeric/Pure functions. This is very
helpful if you're developing new Pure functions to be used in Gnumeric. It
also lets you use Gnumeric as a kind of GUI frontend to the Pure
interpreter. You can try this now. Open the ``pure-examples`` spreadsheet in
Gnumeric and enter the following into the input cell of the Pure shell::

  > scanl (+) 0 (1..20)
    [0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55,66,78,91,105,120,136,153,171,190,210]

Note that here and in the following the prompt ``>`` indicates a Pure
expression to be evaluated in *Gnumeric* (rather than the standalone Pure
interpreter), which is followed by another line indicating the result (printed
in the output cell below the input cell of the Pure shell). You can find the
Pure shell at the bottom of the first sheet in ``pure-examples``, see the
screenshot below. For your convenience, there's also a second, bigger one on
the second sheet. You might want to copy this over to a separate spreadsheet
which you can use as a scratchpad for experimentation purposes.

.. figure:: shell.png
   :scale: 50

   The Pure shell.

Also note that this in fact *Pure code* (not a Gnumeric formula) being
evaluated there. You can execute any Pure code, including Pure declarations,
so you can type::

  > using system; puts "Hello, world!";
    14

This prints the string ``"Hello, world!"`` on standard output, visible in the
terminal window where you launched Gnumeric. Here is another example, showing
how you can invoke any function from the C library, by declaring it as a Pure
``extern`` function::

  > extern int rand(); [rand | i = 1..5];
    [1810821799,2106746672,1436605662,1363610028,695042099]

All functions in the Pure prelude are readily available in the Gnumeric Pure
shell, as well as the functions defined in ``pure_func.pure`` and its imports,
including the programming interface described in `Advanced Features`_. For
instance, here's how you can retrieve a cell value from the current sheet::

  > get_cell "A1"
    "Gnumeric/Pure Examples"

Using ``call`` (see `Calling Gnumeric from Pure`_), you can also invoke any
Gnumeric function::

  > call "product" (1..10)
    3628800.0

Defining Your Own Functions
===========================

After playing around with ``pure_func.pure`` and the interactive Pure shell
for a while, of course you will want to write your own functions, that's what
this plugin is about after all! For the beginning, you can just add your
definitions to the existing ``pure_func.pure`` script. Use the "Edit Pure
Script" option to edit the script in your favourite editor, and see the
comments and the examples in the script for guidance. (This document assumes
that you're already familiar with Pure, if not then you should consult the
available Pure documentation.)

Note that if you delete or rename any functions in this file, or add new ones
to it, then you also have to change the list of function names in the
plugin.xml file in the same directory accordingly. This file tells Gnumeric
which functions are provided by the script. Unfortunately, you'll have to
restart Gnumeric to make changes in this file take effect. If you only change
the definition of an existing function then it's usually sufficient to just
invoke "Reload Pure Scripts" afterwards, and maybe run "Recalculate" (``F9``)
to recompute the spreadsheet. However, if you also made changes to the
function descriptions provided via ``gnm_info`` (see the following section for
explanation), then you'll also have to restart Gnumeric so that it picks up
the changes.

Once you understand how this works, you can also create your own plugin
directories with your personal collections of Gnumeric/Pure functions, using
the ``pure-func`` directory as a template. For instance, let's assume that
your Gnumeric/Pure stuff is in a script named ``gnumeric.pure`` under
``/some/path/pure/gnumeric``. The plugin.xml file in that directory might look
as follows::

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <plugin id="Gnumeric_MyPureFunc">
    <information>
      <name>My Pure functions</name>
      <description>My Pure functions for use in Gnumeric.</description>
      <require_explicit_enabling/>
    </information>
    <loader type="Gnumeric_PureLoader:pure">
      <attribute value="gnumeric" name="module_name"/>
    </loader>
    <services>
      <service type="function_group" id="my_pure_func">
        <category>Pure</category>
        <functions>
	  <!-- My Pure functions go here, e.g.: -->
          <function name="my_pure_func"/>
        </functions>
      </service>
    </services>
  </plugin>

The following steps are needed to tell Gnumeric about your new Pure plugin:

* Open the Directories tab in the Tools/Plug-ins dialog and check that the
  ``/some/path/pure`` directory is in your plugin search path. Add it if
  necessary, and restart Gnumeric after that. (Note that you really have to
  add the *parent* directory ``/some/path/pure``, not
  ``/some/path/pure/gnumeric`` itself.)

* The new plugin should now be listed as "My Pure functions" on the Plugin
  List tab in the Tools/Plug-ins dialog. Check it to enable it.

The Pure loader can load multiple Pure plugins. You only need to tell Gnumeric
about them after creating the scripts and plugin.xml files and placing them
into corresponding plugin directories. Just enable the ones that you want in
Tools/Plug-ins. All scripts are loaded in the same Pure interpreter (and thus
are treated like one big script) so that functions in one script can use the
function and variable definitions in another. If you need to access the
definitions in the ``pure_func.pure`` "mother script", you can also just
import it into your scripts with a ``using`` clause, i.e.: ``using pure_func;``

Gnumeric/Pure Interface
=======================

By default, when a Pure function is called from Gnumeric, it receives its
arguments in a list. However, it is possible to tell Gnumeric about the
expected arguments of the function and also specify a help text to be
displayed in the "f(x)" dialog, by giving a definition of the special
``gnm_info`` function as explained below.

Function Descriptions
---------------------

To describe a given function to Gnumeric, define ``gnm_info "<name>"`` (where
``<name>`` is the name of the function) as a pair with the following elements:

* The first element, a string, gives the signature of the function. E.g.,
  ``""`` denotes a function without arguments, ``"f"`` a function taking a
  single float parameter, ``"fs"`` a function taking a float and a string
  argument (in that order), etc. Optional parameters can be indicated using
  ``|``, as in ``"ff|s"`` (two non-optional floats, followed by an optional
  string). See below for a complete list of the supported parameter types.

* The second element is a list of hash pairs ``key=>text`` which together make
  up the help text shown in Gnumeric's "f(x)" dialog. You should at least
  specify the function name along with a short synopsis here, e.g.
  ``GNM_FUNC_HELP_NAME => "frob:the frob function"``. Parameter descriptions
  take the form ``GNM_FUNC_HELP_ARG => "x:integer"``. There are a number of
  other useful elements, see below for details.

Both the signature and the function description are optional. That is,
``gnm_info`` may return either just a signature string, or a list of hash
pairs with the function description, or both. The signature defaults to a
variadic function which takes any number of parameters of any type (see
below), and the description defaults to some boilerplate text which says that
the function hasn't been documented yet.

Note that if no signature is given, then the function accepts any number of
parameters of any type. In that case, or if there are optional parameters, the
function becomes variadic and the (optional) parameters are passed as a Pure
list (in addition to the non-optional parameters).

Here's the list of valid parameter types, as they are documented in the
Gnumeric sources::

    f : float 		no errors, string conversion attempted
    b : boolean		identical to f
    s : string		no errors
    S : scalar		any non-error scalar
    E : scalar		any scalar, including errors

    r : cell range	content may not be evaluated yet
    A : area		array, range (as above), or scalar
    ? : anything        any value (scalars, non-scalars, errors, whatever)

The keys used in the function description may be any of the following, along
with sample text for each type of field::

    GNM_FUNC_HELP_NAME         => "name:synopsis"
    GNM_FUNC_HELP_ARG	       => "name:parameter description"
    GNM_FUNC_HELP_DESCRIPTION  => "Long description."
    GNM_FUNC_HELP_NOTE	       => "Note."
    GNM_FUNC_HELP_EXAMPLES     => "=sample_formula()"
    GNM_FUNC_HELP_SEEALSO      => "foo,bar,..."

The following keys are only supported in the latest Gnumeric versions::

    GNM_FUNC_HELP_EXTREF       => "wiki:en:Trigonometric_functions"
    GNM_FUNC_HELP_EXCEL	       => "Excel compatibility information."
    GNM_FUNC_HELP_ODF	       => "OpenOffice compatibility information."

Note that inside the descriptions, the notation ``@{arg}`` (``@arg`` in older
Gnumeric versions) can be used to refer to a parameter value. For instance,
here's a sample description for a binary function which also includes a help
text::

  gnm_info "pure_max" = "ff",
  [GNM_FUNC_HELP_NAME     => "pure_max:maximum of two numbers",
   GNM_FUNC_HELP_ARG	  => "x:number",
   GNM_FUNC_HELP_ARG	  => "y:number",
   GNM_FUNC_HELP_DESCRIPTION =>
   "Computes the maximum of two numbers @{x} and @{y}.",
   GNM_FUNC_HELP_EXAMPLES => "=pure_max(17,22)"];

As you can see, the function descriptions are a bit unwieldy, so it's
convenient to construct them using this little helper function defined in
``pure_func.pure``::

  gnm_help name::string args descr::string notes examples see_also =
    [GNM_FUNC_HELP_NAME         => name] +
    [GNM_FUNC_HELP_ARG          => x | x::string = args ] +
    [GNM_FUNC_HELP_DESCRIPTION  => descr ] +
    [GNM_FUNC_HELP_NOTE         => x | x::string = notes ] +
    [GNM_FUNC_HELP_EXAMPLES     => x | x::string = examples ] +
    (if null see_also then [] else
     [GNM_FUNC_HELP_SEEALSO     => join "," see_also]);

Now the description can be written simply as follows::

  gnm_info "pure_max" = "ff", gnm_help "pure_max:maximum of two numbers"
    ["x:number", "y:number"]
    "Computes the maximum of two numbers @{x} and @{y}."
    [] ["=pure_max(17,22)"] [];

Since this function only has fixed arguments, it will be called in curried
form, i.e., as ``pure_max x y``. For instance, the actual definition of
``pure_max`` may look as follows::

  pure_max x y = max x y;

Conversely, if no signature is given, then the function accepts any number of
parameters of any type, which are passed as a list. For instance::

  gnm_info "pure_sum" = gnm_help "pure_sum:sum of a collection of numbers"
    [] "Computes the sum of a collection of numbers."
    [] ["=pure_sum(1,2,3,4,5,6)"] ["pure_sums"];

Here the function will be called as ``pure_sum [x1,x2,...]``, where ``x1``,
``x2``, etc. are the arguments the function is invoked with. Note that in this
case there may be any number of arguments (including zero) of any type, so
your function definition must be prepared to handle this. If a function does
not have a ``gnm_info`` description at all then it is treated in the same
fashion. The ``pure_func.pure`` script contains some examples showing how to
write functions which can deal with any numbers of scalars, arrays or ranges,
see the ``pure_sum`` and ``pure_sums`` examples. These employ the following
``ranges`` function to "flatten" a parameter list to a list holding all
denoted values::

  ranges xs = cat [ case x of _::matrix = list x; _ = [x] end | x = xs ];

E.g., the ``pure_sum`` function can now be defined as follows::

  pure_sum xs = foldl (+) 0 (ranges xs);

A function may also have both fixed and optional arguments (note that in what
follows we're going to omit the detailed function descriptions for brevity)::

  gnm_info "foo" = "ff|ff";

In this case the fixed arguments are passed in curried form as usual, while
the optional parameters are passed as a list. That is, ``foo`` may be called
as ``foo x y []``, ``foo x y [z]`` or ``foo x y [z,t]``, depending on whether
it is invoked with two, three or four arguments.

Conversions Between Pure and Gnumeric Values
--------------------------------------------

The marshalling of types between Gnumeric and Pure is pretty straightforward;
basically, Pure numbers, strings and matrices map to Gnumeric numbers, strings
and arrays, respectively. The following table summarizes the available
conversions:

===============================    ===============================
Pure                               Gnumeric
===============================    ===============================
``gnm_error "#N/A"``               error
``4711``, ``4711L``, ``4711.0``    scalar (number)
``"Hello world"``                  string
``()``                             empty
``(1,2,3)``                        array
``[1,2,3]``                        array
``{1,2,3;4,5,6}``                  array (or cell range)
``"A1:B10"``                       cell range (``"r"`` conversion)
===============================    ===============================

These conversions mostly work both ways. Note that on input, cell ranges are
usually passed as matrices to Pure functions (i.e., they are passed "by
value"), unless the function signature specifies a ``"r"`` conversion in which
case the cell ranges themselves are passed to the function in string form.
(Such values can also be passed on to Gnumeric functions which expect a cell
range (``"r"`` ) parameter, see `Calling Gnumeric from Pure`_ below.)

Conversely, matrices, lists and tuples all become Gnumeric arrays on output,
so usually you'll want to enter these as array functions (``Ctrl-Shift-Enter``
in Gnumeric). As a special case, the empty tuple can be used to denote empty
cell values (but note that empty Gnumeric values may become zeros when passed
as float or array arguments to Pure functions).

If a Pure function returns a value that doesn't match any of the above then it
is converted to a string in Pure expression syntax and that string is returned
as the result of the function invocation in Gnumeric. This makes it possible
to return any kind of symbolic Pure value, but note that if such a value is
then fed into another Pure function, that function will have to convert the
string value back to the internal representation if needed; this can be done
very conveniently using Pure's ``eval`` function, see the Pure documentation
for details.

Advanced Features
=================

This section explains various additional features provided by the
Gnumeric/Pure interface that should be useful for writing your own functions.
Note that, for your convenience all functions discussed in this section are
declared in ``pure_func.pure``.

Calling Gnumeric from Pure
--------------------------

It is possible to call Gnumeric functions from Pure using the ``call``
function which takes the name of the function (a string) as its first, and the
parameters as the second (list) argument. For instance::

  gnm_info "gnm_bitand" = "ff";
  gnm_bitand x y = call "bitand" [x,y];

Note that ``call`` is an external C function provided by Gnumeric/Pure. If
you want to use it, it must be declared in your Pure script as follows::

  extern expr* pure_gnmcall(char* name, expr* args) = call;

However, ``pure_func.pure`` already contains the above declaration, so you
don't have to do this yourself if you import ``pure_func.pure`` in your
scripts.

Also note that ``call`` doesn't do any of Gnumeric's automatic conversions on
the parameters, so you have to pass the proper types of arguments as required
by the function.

Accessing Spreadsheet Cells
---------------------------

Gnumeric/Pure provides the following functions to retrieve and modify the
contents of spreadsheet cells and ranges of such cells::

  extern expr* pure_get_cell(char* s) = get_cell;
  extern expr* pure_get_cell_text(char* s) = get_cell_text;
  extern expr* pure_set_cell(char* s, expr *x) = set_cell;
  extern expr* pure_set_cell_text(char* s, expr *x) = set_cell_text;
  extern expr* pure_get_range(char* s) = get_range;
  extern expr* pure_get_range_text(char* s) = get_range_text;
  extern expr* pure_set_range(char* s, expr *x) = set_range;
  extern expr* pure_set_range_text(char* s, expr *x) = set_range_text;

For instance, here's how you use these functions to write and then read some
cell values (try this in the interactive Pure shell)::

  > set_cell "A14" 42
    ()
  > get_cell "A14"
    42.0
  > set_range "A14:G14" $ scanl (*) 1 (1..6)
    ()
  > get_range "A14:G14"
    {1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,24.0,120.0,720.0}
  > set_cell_text "A14" "=sum(B14:G14)"
    ()
  > get_cell "A14"
    873.0
  > get_cell_text "A14"
    "=sum(B14:G14)"
  > get_range_text "A14:G14"
    {"=sum(B14:G14)","1","2","6","24","120","720"}

Note that while the ``set_cell`` function sets the given cell to a constant
value, ``set_cell_text`` also allows you to store a formula in a cell which
will then be evaluated as usual. Similarly, ``get_cell`` retrieves the cell
value, while ``get_cell_text`` yields the text in the cell, as entered by the
user (which will either be a formula or the textual representation of a
constant value). The ``set_range``, ``set_range_text``, ``get_range`` and
``get_range_text`` functions work analogously, but are used to manipulate
entire ranges of cells, which can be set from Pure tuples, lists or matrices,
and retrieved as Pure matrices.

There are also functions to get the position of the "current" cell (i.e., the
cell from which a Pure function was called), and to translate between cell
ranges in Gnumeric syntax and the corresponding internal representation
consisting of a pointer to a Gnumeric sheet and the cell or range
coordinates::

  extern expr* pure_this_cell() = this_cell;
  extern expr* pure_parse_range(char* s) = parse_range;
  extern expr* pure_make_range(expr* x) = make_range;

Examples::

  > this_cell
    "B4"
  > parse_range this_cell
    #<pointer 0x875220>,1,3
  > make_range (NULL,0,0,10,10)
    "Sheet2!A1:K11"

Asynchronous Data Sources
-------------------------

Gnumeric/Pure makes it easy to set up asynchronous data sources which draw
values from a Pure computation executed in a background process. This facility
is useful to carry out lengthy computations in the background while you can
continue to work with your spreadsheet. It also allows you to process incoming
data and asynchronous events from special devices (MIDI, sensors, stock
tickers, etc.) in (soft) realtime.

To do this, you simply pass an expression to the ``datasource`` function. This
is another external C function provided by Gnumeric/Pure, which is declared in
``pure_func.pure`` as follows::

  extern expr* pure_datasource(expr* x) = datasource;

The argument to ``datasource`` is typically a thunk or stream (lazy list)
which is to be evaluated in the background. The call to ``datasource``
initially returns a ``#N/A`` value (``gnm_error "#N/A"``) while the
computation is still in progress. The cell containing the data source then
gets updated automatically as soon as the value becomes available, at which
point the ``datasource`` call now returns the computed value. E.g., here's how
you would wrap up a lengthy calculation as a thunk and submit it to
``datasource`` which carries out the computation as a background task::

  gnm_info "pure_frob" = "f";
  pure_frob x = datasource (lengthy_calculation x&);
  lengthy_calculation x = sleep 3 $$ foldl (*) 1 (1..x);

Note that a cell value may draw values from as many independent data sources
as you want, so the definition of a cell may also involve multiple invocations
of ``datasource``::

  gnm_info "pure_frob2" = "ff";
  pure_frob2 x y = datasource (lengthy_calculation x&),
    datasource (lengthy_calculation y&);

Special treatment is given to (lazy) lists, in this case ``datasource``
returns a new value each time a list element becomes available. For instance,
the following function uses an infinite stream to count off the seconds
starting from a given initial value::

  gnm_info "pure_counter" = "f";
  pure_counter x = datasource [sleep (i>x) $$ i | i = x..inf];

You can also try this interactively in the Pure shell::

  > datasource [sleep (i>0) $$ i | i = 0..inf]
    0
    1
    ...

Here's another example for the Pure shell which prints the prime numbers::

  > datasource primes with primes = sieve (2..inf);
      sieve (p:qs) = p : (sleep 1 $$ sieve [q | q = qs; q mod p])& end
    2
    3
    5
    ...

Note that when processing a lazy list, the cell containing the call will keep
changing as long as new values are produced (i.e., forever in this
example). The "Stop Data Sources" option in the Tools/Pure menu can be used to
stop all active data sources. "Reload Pure Scripts" also does this. You can
then restart the data sources at any time by using "Recalculate" (``F9``) to
recompute the spreadsheet.

Also note that because of the special way that ``datasource`` handles list
values, you cannot return a list directly as the result of ``datasource``, if
it is to be treated as a single result. Instead, you'll have to wrap the
result in a singleton list (e.g., ``datasource [[lengthy_calculation
x,lengthy_calculation y]&]``), or return another aggregate (i.e., a matrix or
a tuple).

Finally, note that when the arguments of a call involving ``datasource``
change (because they depend on other cells which may have been updated), the
computation is automatically restarted with the new parameters. The default
behaviour in this case is that the entire computation will be redone from
scratch, but it's also possible to wrap up calls to ``datasource`` in a manner
which enables more elaborate communication between Gnumeric and background
tasks initiated with ``datasource``. This is beyond the scope of this manual,
however, so we leave this as an exercise to the interested reader.

Triggers
--------

In addition to asynchronous data sources, the ``trigger`` macro is provided to
compute values or take actions depending on some external condition, such as
the availability of data on a special device or the creation of some widget
(see the next section). The ``trigger`` macro is invoked as follows::

  trigger timeout condition value

The ``condition`` and ``value`` arguments are implicitly quoted. The trigger
reevaluates the given condition in regular intervals (1 second in the current
implementation) and, as soon as it becomes ``true``, computes the given value
and returns that value as the result of the ``trigger`` call. As long as the
condition doesn't hold, ``trigger`` returns a ``#N/A`` value (``gnm_error
"#N/A"``). Note that, in difference to ``datasource``, both the condition and
the value are evaluated in Gnumeric (rather than a child process), so that it
is possible to access the current information in the loaded spreadsheet.

The ``timeout`` value determines how often the condition is checked. If it is
positive, the condition will be reevaluated ``timeout+1`` times (once
initially, and then once per second for a total duration of ``timeout``
seconds). If it is negative, the trigger never times out and the condition
will be checked repeatedly until the trigger expression is removed (or
Gnumeric is exited). In either case the ``value`` will be reevaluated each
time the ``condition`` is ``true``. (This is most useful if the computed
value, as a side effect, arranges for the condition to become ``false`` again
afterwards.) Finally, if ``timeout`` is zero then the trigger fires at most
once, as soon as the condition becomes ``true``, at which point the ``value``
is evaluated just once.

Here's a (rather useless) example of a trigger which fires exactly once, as
soon as a certain cell goes to a certain value, and then modifies another cell
value accordingly::

  > trigger 0 (get_cell "A14"==="Hello") (set_cell "A15" "World")

Now, as soon as you type ``Hello`` in the cell A14, the trigger will print
``World`` in cell A15. A more useful example will be discussed in the
following section.

Sheet Objects
-------------

Gnumeric offers some kinds of special objects which can be placed on a
sheet. This comprises the chart and image objects which can be found in the
"Insert" menu, as well as a number of useful graphical elements and GUI
widgets on the "Object" toolbar, accessible via "View/Toolbars". The latter
are also useful for providing control input to Pure functions.

Gnumeric/Pure provides the following function to retrieve information about
the special objects in a spreadsheet::

  extern expr* pure_sheet_objects() = sheet_objects;

For instance, with one button object in your spreadsheet, the output of
``sheet_objects`` might look like this::

  > sheet_objects
    [("Sheet1","button","Push Me!","A11",[#<pointer 0x2a1dcd0>])]

Each object is described by a tuple which lists the name of the sheet on which
the object is located, the type of object, the object's content or label (if
applicable), the cell which the object is linked to (if applicable), and a
list of pointers to the corresponding ``GtkWidgets`` (if any). Note that in
general a GUI object may be associated with several widgets, as Gnumeric
allows you to have multiple views on the same spreadsheet, so there will be
one widget for each view an object is visible in. Also note that the
content/label information depends on the particular type of object:

* List and combo widgets return the content link (referring to the cells in
  the spreadsheet holding the items shown in the list).

* Frame and button widgets return the label shown on the widget.

* Graphic objects like rectangles and ellipses return the text content of the
  object.

* Image objects (type ``"image/xyz"``, where ``xyz`` is the type of image,
  such as ``svg`` or ``png``) return a pointer to the image data in this
  field.

The ``sheet_objects`` function is a bit tricky to use, since some of the
objects or their associated widgets might not have been created yet when the
spreadsheet is loaded. Therefore it is necessary to use a trigger to make sure
that the information is updated once all objects are fully displayed. The
``pure_func.pure`` script contains the following little wrapper around
``sheet_objects`` which does this::

  pure_objects =
    trigger 0 (all realized sheet_objects) (matrix$map list sheet_objects)
  with realized (_,_,_,_,w) = ~listp w || ~null w && ~any null w end;

See the ``widgets.gnumeric`` spreadsheet in the distribution for an example.

Possible uses of this facility are left to your imagination. Using Gnumeric's
internal APIs and Pure's Gtk interface, you might manipulate the GUI widgets
in various ways (add icons to buttons or custom child widgets to frames,
etc.). One particularly useful case, for which Gnumeric/Pure has built-in
support, is rendering an OpenGL scene in a Gnumeric frame widget, see below.

OpenGL Interface
----------------

Gnumeric/Pure provides special support for rendering OpenGL scenes into
Gnumeric frame widgets. To actually use this, you must have Pure's OpenGL
module installed. The following function is provided to equip a Gnumeric frame
with the OpenGL rendering capability::

  extern expr *pure_gl_window(char *name, int timeout,
                              expr *setup_cb, expr *config_cb,
                              expr *display_cb, expr *timer_cb,
                              expr *user_data) = gl_window;

The meaning of the parameters is as follows:

* ``name`` is a string which specifies the label of the frame widget into
  which the scene is to be rendered.

* ``timeout`` is a time value in milliseconds (an integer) which specifies the
  period for invocations of the ``timer_cb`` callback, see below. If this
  value is zero or negative then the timer callback is disabled.

* ``setup_cb``, ``config_cb``, ``display_cb`` and ``timer_cb`` are the Pure
  callback functions which are invoked by ``gl_window`` to actually render the
  scene. The callbacks are all invoked with two arguments: the ``user_data``
  parameter that ``gl_window`` was invoked with, and a second parameter with
  callback-specific information as described below.

* ``user_data`` is any information that the caller wants to be passed as the
  first argument to the callback functions.

The different callbacks are:

* ``setup_cb`` is called for initializing the scene. It receives the
  ``GtkDrawingArea`` widget as the second argument. Typically this is used to
  set the initial projection and modelview matrices, enable lighting, etc.

* ``config_cb`` is called when width or height of the frame widget changes so
  that the rendering parameters (typically the viewport) can be adjusted
  accordingly. It is invoked with a pair of integers ``(w,h)`` as the second
  argument, which denotes the new dimension allocated to the drawing area.

* ``display_cb`` is called whenever the contents of the drawing area needs to
  be redrawn. This typically does most of the work necessary to render the
  scene. The second callback argument is always ``()``.

* ``timer_cb`` is called at regular intervals as specified with the
  ``timeout`` parameter (see above), unless the ``timeout`` value is zero or
  negative in which case this callback is disabled. The second callback
  argument is always ``()``. The timer callback is typically used to
  incrementally adjust some parameters of the scene in order to render
  animations. When invoked, the callback automatically arranges for
  ``display_cb`` to be called afterwards, so you don't have to do that
  manually in your callback definition.

You'll need at least either the ``display_cb`` or the ``timer_cb`` function to
render anything, but typically all of these callbacks will be needed for
animated scenes. Callback functions which aren't needed can be specified as
``()``.

There's also a related helper function which can be used as a trigger
condition to defer rendering until the target frame widget has been realized::

  extern bool pure_check_window(char *name) = check_window;

This function returns ``true`` as soon as the named frame widget is ready to
go, at wich time ``gl_windows`` can be called on the widget. So your call to
``gl_windows`` should usually be wrapped up like this::

  trigger 0 (check_window frame)
  (gl_window frame timeout setup config display timer user_data)

Here's an example from ``pure_glfunc.pure`` which shows how these functions
are to be used. Have a look at the ``gl-example.gnumeric`` spreadsheet
included in the distribution to see this example in action. (You first need to
enable the "Pure OpenGL functions" in the Plugin Manager to make this work.)
The screenshot below shows how the example looks like in Gnumeric.
