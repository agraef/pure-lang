Pure-XML - XML/XSLT interface

XML_, the Extensible Markup Language, facilitates the exchange of complex
structured data between applications and systems. XSLT_ allows you to
transform XML documents to other XML-based formats such as HTML. Together, XML
and XSLT let you create dynamic web content with ease. Both XML and XSLT are
open standards by the W3C consortium (http://www.w3.org).

.. _XML: http://www.w3.org/TR/xml
.. _XSLT: http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt

Pure's XML interface is based on the libxml2 and libxslt libraries from the
GNOME project. If you have a Linux system then you most likely have these
libraries, otherwise you can get them from http://xmlsoft.org. For Windows
users, the required dlls are available from the GnuWin32 project
(http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net) and are already included in the Pure MSI
package.

Installation
============

Run ``make`` and then ``sudo make install`` to compile and install this module
from source. This requires libxml2, libxslt and Pure.

Usage
=====

Use the following declaration to make the operations of this module available
in your programs::

  using xml;

The module defines two namespaces ``xml`` and ``xslt`` for the XML and the
XSLT operations, respectively. For convenience, you can open these in your
program as follows::

  using namespace xml, xslt;

A number of complete examples illustrating the use of this module can be found
in the examples directory in the source distribution.
