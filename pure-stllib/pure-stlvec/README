Installation
============

pure-stlvec-@version@ is included in the "umbrella" addon, :doc:`pure-stllib`,
which is available at http://code.google.com/p/pure-lang/downloads/list. After
you have downloaded and installed :doc:`pure-stllib`, you will be able to use
pure-stlvec (and :doc:`pure-stlmap`, as well).

Overview
========

The C++ Standard Template Library ("STL") is a library of generic containers
(data structures designed for storing other objects) and a rich set of generic
algorithms that operate on them. pure-stlvec provides an interface to one of
its most useful containers, "vector", adopted to hold pointers to Pure
expressions. The interface provides Pure programmers with a mutable container
"stlvec", that, like the STL's vector, holds a sequence of objects that can be
accessed in constant time according to their position in the sequence.

Modules
-------

The usual operations for creating, accessing and modifying stlvecs are
provided by the stlvec module. Most of the operations are similar in name and
function to those provided by the Pure Library for other containers. As is the
case for their Pure Library counterparts, these operations are in the global
namespace. There are a few operations that have been placed in the stl
namespace usually because they do not have Pure Library counterparts.

In addition to the stlvec module, pure-stlvec provides a group of modules,
stlvec::modifying, stlvec::nonmodifying, stlvec::sort, stlvec::merge,
stlvec::heap, stlvec::minmax and stlvec::numeric, that are straight wrappers
the STL algorithms (specialized to work with STL vectors of pointers to Pure
expressions). This grouping of the STL algorithms follows that found at
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/. This web page contains a table
that summarizes of all of the algorithms in one place.

pure-stlvec provides an "umbrella" module, :mod:`stlvec::algorithms`, that
pulls in all of the STL algorithm interface modules in one go. The STL
algorithm wrapper functions reside in the stl namespace and have the same
names as their counterparts in the STL.

Simple Examples
---------------

Here are some examples that use the basic operations provided by the
stlvec module. ::

    > using stlvec;

    > let sv1 = stlvec (0..4); members sv1;
    [0,1,2,3,4]

    > insert (sv1,stl::svend) (5..7); members sv1;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0xaf4d2c0>
    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

    > sv1!3;
    3

    > sv1!![2,4,6];
    [2,4,6]

    > replace sv1 3 33; members sv1;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0xaf4d2c0>
    [0,1,2,33,4,5,6,7]

    > stl::erase (sv1,2,5); members sv1;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0xaf4d2c0>
    [0,1,5,6,7]

    > insert (sv1,2) [2,3,4];  members sv1;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0xaf4d2c0>
    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

    > let pure_vector = stl::vector (sv1,1,5); pure_vector;
    {1,2,3,4}

    > stlvec pure_vector;
    STLVEC #<pointer 0x9145a38>

    > members ans;
    [1,2,3,4]

     > map (+10) sv1;
    [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]

    > map (+10) (sv1,2,5);
    [12,13,14]

    > foldl (+) 0 sv1;
    28

    > [x+10 | x = sv1; x mod 2];
    [11,13,15,17]

    > {x+10 | x = (sv1,2,6); x mod 2};
    {13,15}


Here are some examples that use STL algorithms. ::

    > using stlvec::algorithms;

    > stl::reverse (sv1,2,6); members sv1;
    ()
    [0,1,5,4,3,2,6,7]

    > stl::stable_sort sv1 (>); members sv1;
    ()
    [7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]

    > stl::random_shuffle sv1; members sv1 1;
    ()
    [1,3,5,4,0,7,6,2]

    > stl::partition sv1 (<3); members (sv1,0,ans); members sv1;
    3
    [1,2,0]
    [1,2,0,4,5,7,6,3]

    > stl::transform sv1 (sv1,0) (*2); members sv1;
    -1
    [2,4,0,8,10,14,12,6]

    > let sv2 = emptystlvec;

    > stl::transform sv1 (sv2,stl::svback) (div 2); members sv2;
    -1
    [1,2,0,4,5,7,6,3]

Many more examples can be found in the pure-stlvec/ut directory.

Members and Sequences of Members
--------------------------------

Throughout the documentation for pure-stlvec, the member of a stlvec that is
at the nth position in the sequence of expressions stored in the stlvec is
referred to as its nth member or nth element. The nth member of a stlvec, sv,
is sometimes denoted by sv!n.  The sequence of members of sv starting at
position i up to but not including j is denoted by sv[i,j). There is a
"past-the-end" symbol, stl::svend, that denotes the position after that
occupied by the last member contained by a stlvec.

For example, if sv contains the sequence "a", "b", "c" "d" and "e", sv!0 is
"a", sv[1,3) is the sequence consisting of "b" followed by "c" and
v[3,stl::svend) denotes the sequence consisting of "d" followed by "e".

STL Iterators and Value Semantics
---------------------------------

In C++ a programmer accesses a STL container's elements by means of
"iterators", which can be thought of as pointers to the container's
elements. A single iterator can be used to access a specific element, and a
pair of iterators can be used to access a "range" of elements. By convention,
such a range includes the member pointed to by the first iterator and all
succeeding members up to but not including the member pointed to by the second
iterator. Each container has a past-the-end iterator that can be used to
specifiy ranges that include the container's last member.

In the case of vectors there is an obvious correspondence between an iterator
that points to an element and the element's position (starting at zero) in the
vector.  pure-stlvec uses this correspondence to designate a stlvec's members
in a way that makes it relatively easy to see how pure-stlvec's functions are
acting on the stlvec's underlying STL vector by referencing the STL's
documentation. Thus, if sv is a stlvec, and j is an int, "replace sv j x" uses
the STL to replace the element pointed to by the iterator for position j of
sv's underlying STL vector. If, in addition, k is an int, stl::sort (sv,j,k)
(<) uses the STL to sort the elements in the range designated by the "jth" and
"kth" iterators for sv's underlying STL vector. This range, written as
sv[j,k), is the subsequence of sv that begins with the element at position j
and ends with the element at position (k-1).

Besides iterators, another cornerstone of the STL is its "value semantics",
i.e., all of the STL containers are mutable and if a container is copied, all
of its elements are copied. pure-stlvec deals with the STL's value semantics
by introducing mutable and nonmutable stlvecs, and by storing smart pointers
to objects (which have cheap copies) rather than the actual objects.

Iterator Tuples
---------------

As mentioned in the previous section, in C++ ranges are specified by a pair
of STL iterators.

In pure-stlvec ranges of elements in a stlvec are specified by "iterator
tuples" rather than, say, actual pointers to STL iterators. Iterator tuples
consist of the name of a stlvec followed by one of more ints that indicate
positions (starting from zero) of the stlvec's elements.

To illustrate how iterator tuples are used, consider the STL stable_sort
function, which sorts objects in the range [first, last) in the order imposed
by comp. Its C++ signature looks like this:

  void stable_sort ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last, Compare comp )

The corresponding pure-stlvec function, from the stlvec::sort module, looks like
this:

   stable_sort (msv, first, last) comp

where msv is a mutable stlvec, and first and last are ints. The first thing
that the Pure stable_sort does is create a pair of C++ iterators that point to
the elements in msv's underlying STL vector that occupy the positions
designated by first and last.  Next it wraps the Pure comp function in a C++
function object that, along with the two iterators, is passed to the C++
stable_sort function.

For convenience, (sv,stl::svbeg, stl::svend) can be written simply as
sv. Thus, if first were stl::svbeg (or 0), and last were stl::svend (or #msv,
the number of elements in msv), the last Pure call could be written:

   stable_sort msv comp

It should be noted that often the STL library provides a default version of its
functions, which like stable_sort, use a comparator or other callback function
provided by the caller. E.g., the C++ stable_sort has a default version that
assumes the "<" operator can be used on the elements held by the container in
question:

   void stable_sort ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last)

The corresponding functions provided by the pure-stlvec modules rarely, if
ever, supply a default version. A typical example is stlvec::sort's stable_sort
which must be called with a comparator callback function:

  stable_sort msv (<);

Note also that the comparator (e.g., (<)), or other function being passed to a
pure-stlvec algorithm wrapper is almost always the last parameter. This
is the opposite of what is required for similar Pure functions, but is
consistent with the STL calling conventions.

Predefined Iterator Tuple Indexes
---------------------------------

The following integer constants are defined in the stl namespace for use
in iterator tuples.

.. namespace:: stl

.. constant:: svbeg = 0
              svend = -1 
              svback = -2

These three symbols are declared as nonfix. ``svend`` corresponds to STL's
past-end iterator for STL vectors. It makes it possible to specify ranges that
include the last element of an stlvec. I.e., the iterator tuple
(sv,stl::svbeg,stl::svend) would specify sv[0,n), where n is the number of
elements in sv. In order to understand the purpose of ``svback``, it is
necessary to understand a bit about STL's "back insert iterators."

Back Insert Iterators
---------------------

Many of the STL algorithms insert members into a target range designated by an
iterator that points to the first member of the target range. Consistent with
raw C usage, it is ok to copy over existing elements the target
stlvec. E.g.,::

   > using stlvec::modifying;

   > let v1 = stlvec (0..2);

   > let v2 = stlvec ("a".."g");

   > stl::copy v1 (v2,2) $$ members v2;
   ["a","b",0,1,2,"f","g"]

This is great for C++ programmers, but for Pure programmers it is almost
always preferable to append the copied items to the end of a target stlvec,
rather than overwriting all or part or part of it. This can be accomplished
using stl::svback. E.g.,::

   > stl::copy v1 (v2,stl::svback) $$ members v2;
   ["a","b",0,1,2,"f","g",0,1,2]

In short, when a pure-stlvec function detects "stl::svback" in a target
iterator tuple, it constructs a STL "back inserter iterator" and passes it on
to the corresponding wrapped STL function.

Data Structure
--------------

Currently, stlvecs are of the form (STLVEC x) or (CONST_STLVEC x), where
STLVEC AND CONST_STLVEC are defined as nonfix symbols in the global namespace
and x is a pointer to the underlying STL vector. The stlvec module defines
corresponding type tags, stlvec and const_stlvec, so the programmer never
needs to worry about the underlying representaton.

This representation may change in the future, and must not be relied upon
by client modules. In particular, one must never attempt to use the
embedded pointer directly.

As the names suggest, stlvecs are mutable and const_stlvecs are
immutable. Functions that modify a stlvec will simply fail unless the stlvec
is mutable. ::

   > let v = const_stlvec $ stlvec (0..3); v2;
   CONST_STLVEC #<pointer 0x8c1dbf0>

   > replace v 0 100; // fails
   replace (CONST_STLVEC #<pointer 0x9f07690> 0 100

Types
-----

pure-stlvec introduces six type tags, all of which are in the global namespace:

.. namespace:: ::

.. type:: mutable_stlvec /type

   The type for a mutable stlvec. 

.. type:: const_stlvec /type

   The type for an immutable stlvec.

.. type:: stlvec /type

   The type for a stlvec, mutable or immutable.

.. type:: mutable_svit /type

   The type for an iterator tuple whose underlying stlvec is mutable.

.. type:: const_svit /type

   The type for an iterator tuple whose underlying stlvec is immutable.
 
.. type:: svit /type

   The type for an iterator tuple. The underlying stlvec can be mutable
   or immutable.

Copy-On-Write Semantics
-----------------------

The pure-stlvec module functions do not implement automatic copy-on-write
semantics. Functions that modify stlvec parameters will simply fail if they
are passed a const_stlvec when they expect a mutable_stlvec.

For those that prefer immutable data structures, stlvecs can be converted to
const_stlvecs (usually after they have been created and modified within a
function) by the ``const_stlvec`` function. This function converts a mutable
stlvec to an immutable stlvec without changing the underlying STL vector. 

Typically, a "pure" function that "modifies" a stlvec passed to it as an
argument will first copy the input stlvec to a new locally scoped (mutable)
stlvec using the stlvec function. It will then modify the new stlvec and use
const_stlvec to make the new stlvec immutable before it is returned. It should
be noted that several of the STL algorithms have "copy" versions which place
their results directly into a new stlvec, which can eliminate the need to copy
the input stlvec. E.g.::

    > let sv1 = stlvec ("a".."e");

    > let sv2 = emptystlvec;

    > stl::reverse_copy sv1 (sv2,stl::svback) $$ members sv2;
    ["e","d","c","b","a"]

Without reverse_copy, one would have had to copy sv1 into sv2 and then reverse
sv2.

If desired, in Pure it is easy to write functions that have automatic
copy-on-write semantics. E.g., ::

    > my_replace csv::const_stlvec i x = my_replace (stlvec csv) i x;
    > my_replace sv::stlvec i x = replace sv i x;

Documentation
-------------

The pure-stllib/doc directory includes a rudimentary cheatsheet,
pure-stllib-cheatsheet.pdf, that shows the signatures of all of the functions
provided by pure-stlvec (and by :doc:`pure-stlmap` as well).

The documentation of the functions provided by the stlvec module are
reasonably complete.  In contrast, the descriptions of functions provided by
the STL algorithm modules are purposely simplified (and may not, therefore, be
technically accurate). This reflects that fact that the functions provided by
pure-stlvec have an obvious correspondence to the functions provided by the
STL, and the STL is extremely well documented. Furthermore, using the Pure
interpreter, it is very easy to simply play around with with any of the
pure-stlvec functions if there are doubts, especially with respect to "corner
cases."  Often this leads to a deeper understanding compared to reading a
precise technical description.

A good book on the STL is STL Tutorial and Reference Guide, Second Edition, by
David R. Musser, Gillmer J. Derge and Atul Saini. A summary of all of the STL
algorithms can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/.

Parameter Names
---------------

In the descriptions of functions that follow, parameter names used in
function descriptions represent specific types of Pure objects:

sv
  stlvec (mutable or immutable)

csv
  const (i.e., immutable) stlvec

msv
  mutable stlvec

x
  an arbitrary Pure expression

xs
  a list of arbitrary Pure expressions

count, sz, n
  whole numbers to indicate a number of elements, size of a vector, etc

i,j
  whole numbers used to designate indexes into a stlvec

f,m,l
  whole numbers (or stl::beg or stl::svend) designating the "first", "middle"
  or "last" iterators in a stlvec iterator tuple

p
  a whole number (or other iterator constant such as stl::svend or
  stl::svback) used in a two element iterator tuple (e.g., (sv,p))

(sv,p)
  an iterator tuple that will be mapped to an iterator that points
  to the pth position of sv's underlying STL vector, v, (or to a
  back iterator on v if p is stl::svback)

(sv,f,l)
  an iterator tuple that will be mapped to the pair of iterators
  that are designated by (sv,f) and (sv,l)

(sv,f,m,l)
  an iterator tuple that will be mapped to the iterators that
  are designated by (sv,f), (sv,m) and (sv,l)

sv[f,l) 
  the range of members beginning with that at (sv,f) up to but not
  including that at (con,l)

comp

unary_fun
  a function that accepts one objects and returns another

bin_fun

For readability, and to correspond with the STL documentation, the words
"first", "middle", and "last", or variants such as "first1" are often used
instead of f,m,l.

Error Handling
==============

The functions provided this module handle errors by throwing exceptions.

Exception Symbols
-----------------

.. constructor:: bad_argument /stlvec

   This exception is thrown when a function is passed an unexpected value. A
   subtle error to watch for is a malformed iterator tuple (e.g., one with
   the wrong number of elements).

.. constructor:: bad_function /stlvec

   This exception is thrown when a purported Pure call-back function is not
   even callable.

.. constructor:: failed_cond /stlvec

   This exception is thrown when a Pure call-back predicate returns a value
   that is not an int.

.. constructor:: out_of_bounds /stlvec

   This exception is thrown if the specified index is out of bounds.

.. constructor:: range_overflow  /stlvec                
 
   This exception is thrown by functions that write over part of a target
   stlvec (e.g., copy) when the target range too small to accommodate the
   result.

.. constructor:: range_overlap  /stlvec

   This exception is thrown by algorithm functions that write over part of a
   target stlvec when the target and source ranges overlap in a way that is
   not allowed.

In addition, any exception thrown by a Pure callback function passed to a
pure-stlvec function will be caught and be rethrown by the pure-stlvec
function.

Examples
--------

::

    > using stlvec, stlvec::modifying;

    > let sv1 = stlvec (0..4); members sv1;
    [0,1,2,3,4]

    > let sv2 = stlvec ("a".."e"); members sv2;
    ["a","b","c","d","e"]

    > sv1!10;
    <stdin>, line 25: unhandled exception 'out_of_bounds' ...

    > stl::copy sv1 (sv2,10);
    <stdin>, line 26: unhandled exception 'out_of_bounds' ...

    > stl::copy sv1 (sv2,2,3); // sb (sv2,pos)
    <stdin>, line 22: unhandled exception 'bad_argument' ...

    > stl::copy sv1 (sv2,2);
    <stdin>, line 23: unhandled exception 'range_overflow' ...

    > stl::copy sv2 (sv2,2);
    <stdin>, line 24: unhandled exception 'range_overlap' ...

    > stl::copy (sv1,1,3) (sv2,0); members sv2; // ok
    2
    [1,2,"c","d","e"]

    > stl::sort sv2 (>); // apples and oranges 
    <stdin>, line 31: unhandled exception 'failed_cond'

    > listmap (\x->throw DOA) sv1; // callback function throws exception
    <stdin>, line 34: unhandled exception 'DOA' ...

Operations Included in the stlvec Module
========================================

The stlvec module provides functions for creating, accessing and modifying
stlvecs. In general, operations that have the same name as a corresponding
function in the Pure standard library are in the global namespace. The
remaining functions, which are usually specific to stlvecs, are in the stl
namespace.

Please note that "stlvec to stlvec" functions are provided by the pure-stl
algorithm modules. Thus, for example, the stlvec module does not provide a
function that maps one stlvec onto a new stlvec. That functionality, and more,
is provided by stl::transform, which can be found in the stlvec::modifying
module.

Imports
-------

To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
to your program::

  using stlvec;

Operations in the Global Namespace
----------------------------------

When reading the function descriptions that follow, please bear in mind that
whenever a function is passed an iterator tuple of the form (sv,first, last),
first and last can be dropped, leaving (sv), or simply sv. The function will
treat the "unary" iterator tuple (sv) as (sv, stl::svbeg, stl::svend).

.. function:: emptystlvec /stlvec

   return an empty stlvec

.. function:: stlvec source /stlvec

   create a new stlvec that contains the elements of source; source can be 
   a stlvec, an iterator tuple(sv,first,last), a list or a vector (i.e.,
   a matrix consisting of a single row or column). The underlying STL vector
   is always a new STL vector. I.e., if source is a stlvec the new stlvec does
   not share source's underlying STL vector.

.. function:: mkstlvec /stlvec x count

   create a new stlvec consisting of count x's.

.. function:: const_stlvec /stlvec source

   create a new const_stlvec that contains the elements of source; source can
   be a stlvec, an iterator tuple(sv,first,last), a list or a vector (i.e., a
   matrix consisting of a single row or column). If source is a stlvec
   (mutable or const), the new const_stlvec shares source's underlying STL
   vector.

.. function:: prefix # /stlvec sv

   return the number of elements in sv. 

Note that # applied to an iterator tuple like (sv,b,e) will just return the
number of elements in the tuple. Use stl::bounds if you need to know the
number of elements in the range denoted by an iterator tuple.

.. function:: infix ! /stlvec sv i

   return the i\th member of sv

Note that !k applied to an iterator tuple like (sv,b,e) will just return the
kth element of the tuple. In addition, in stlvec, integers used to denote
postions (as in !k) or in iterators, *always*, are relative to the beginning
of the underlying vector. So it makes no sense to apply ! to an iterator
tuple.

.. function:: first /stlvec sv
              last /stlvec sv

   first and last member of sv

.. function:: members /stlvec (sv, first, last)

   return a list of values stored in sv[first,last)

.. function:: replace /stlvec msv i x

   replace the i\ th member of msv by x and return x; throws out_of_bounds if
   i is less than 0 or great or equal to the number of elements in msv

.. function:: update /stlvec msv i x

   the same as replace except that update returns msv instead of x. This
   function is DEPRECATED.

.. function:: append /stlvec sv x

   append x to the end of sv

.. function:: insert /stlvec (msv,p) xs
              insert /stlvec (msv,p) (sv,first,last)

   insert members of the list xs or the range sv[first, last)
   into msv, all preceding the pth member of msv. Members are shifted
   to make room for the inserted members

.. function:: rmfirst /stlvec msv
              rmlast /stlvec msv

   remove the first or last member from msv

.. function:: erase /stlvec (msv,first,last)
              erase /stlvec (msv,p)
              erase /stlvec msv

   remove msv[first,last) from msv, remove msv!p from msv, or make msv
   empty. Members are shifted to occupy vacated slots

.. function:: infix == /stlvec sv1 sv2
              infix ~= /stlvec sv1 sv2

   (x == y) is the same as stl::allpairs (==) x y and x ~= y is simply
   ~(allpairs (==) x y)

Note that ``==`` and ``~==`` are not defined for iterator tuples (the rules
would never be executed because == is defined on tuples in the Prelude).

The stlvec module provides convenience functions that apply map, catmap,
foldl, etc, to directly access Pure expressions stored in a stlvec.

.. function:: map /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of map unary_fun $ members (sv, first,
   last)

.. function:: listmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

   same as map, used in list comprehensions

.. function:: catmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of catmap unary_fun $ members (sv, first,
   last)

.. function:: do /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of do unary_fun $ members (sv, first,
   last)

.. function:: foldl /stlvec bin_fun x (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of foldl bin_fun x $ members (sv,
   first, last)

.. function:: foldl1 /stlvec bin_fun (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of foldl1 bin_fun $ members (sv, first,
   last)

.. function:: filter /stlvec unary_pred (sv, first, last)

   one pass equivalent of filter unary_pred $ members (sv, first,
   last)

The following four functions map (or catmap) stlvecs onto row and col
matrixes, primarily for use in matrix comprehensions.

.. function:: rowmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

.. function:: rowcatmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

.. function:: colmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)

.. function:: colcatmap /stlvec unary_fun (sv, first, last)


Operations in the stl Namespace
-------------------------------

.. namespace:: stl

.. function:: empty /stlvec sv

   test whether sv is empty

.. function:: vector /stlvec (sv,first,last)

   create a Pure vector that contains the members of sv[first,last)

.. function:: allpairs /stlvec bin_pred (sv1, first1, last1) (sv2, first2, last2)

   returns true if bin_pred is true for all corresponding members of

   packing data into a fixed size vector and possibly to speed up the addition
   of new members

.. function:: capacity /stlvec sv

   return the number of slots (as opposed to the number of elements) held by
   the underlying STL vector

   Returns the position of the first element, x, in
   sv1[first1,last1) for which there exists y in
   sv2[first2,last2) and (bin_pred x y) is true (or stl::svend if
   no such x exists).

   sv1[first1,last1) and (sv2,first2,first2 + n), with
   n equal to last1-first1 until it finds i and j such
   that bin_pred (sv1!i) (sv2!j) is false and returns
   (i,j). If bin_pred is true for all of the pairs of elements,

   of its first element (or stl::svend if not found)

.. function:: search_n /stlvec (sv, first, last) count x bin_pred

   using bin_pred to determine equality of the elements, searches
   sv[first,last) for a sequence of count elements that equal
   x. If such a sequence is found, it returns the position of the
   first of its elements, otherwise it returns stl::svend

   using bin_pred to determine equality of the elements, searches
   sv1[first1,last1) for the last occurrence of
   sv2[first2,last2). Returns the position of the first element in
   sv1 of the occurrence (or stl::svend if not found).

Examples
--------

See ut_modifying.pure in the pure-stlvec/ut directory.


STL Sort Algorithms
===================

The stlvec::sort module provides an interface to the STL's sorting and binary
search algorithms.

Imports
-------

To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
to your program::

  using stlvec::sort;

All of the functions are in the stl namespace.

Operations
----------

All of the functions in this module require the caller to supply an ordering
function, comp. The functions (<) and (>) are commonly passed as comp.

.. function:: sort /stlvec (msv, first, last) comp

   sorts msv[first, last)

.. function:: stable_sort /stlvec (msv, first, last) comp

   sorts msv[first, last), preserving the relative order of equal
   members

.. function:: partial_sort /stlvec (msv, first, middle, last) comp

   fills msv[first, middle) with the elements of msv[first,last) that would
   appear there if msv[first,last) were sorted using comp and fills
   msv[middle,last) with the remaining elements in unspecified order

.. function:: partial_sort_copy /stlvec (sv, first1, last1) (msv, first2, last2) comp

   let n be the number of elements in sv[first1, last1) and r be the number of
   elements in msv[first2, last2). If r < n, :func:`partial_sort_copy/stlvec`
   fills msv[first2, last2) with the first r elements of what sv[first1,
   last1) would be if it had been sorted. If r >= n, it fills msv[first2,
   first2+n) with the elements of sv[first1, last1) in sorted
   order. sv[first1,last1) is unchanged

.. function:: nth_element /stlvec (msv, first, middle, last) comp

   rearranges the elements of msv[first, last) as follows. Let n be middle -
   first, and let x be the nth smallest element of msv[first, last). After the
   function is called, sv!middle will be x. All of the elements of msv[first,
   middle) will be less than x and all of the elements of msv[middle+1, last)
   will be greater than x

The next four functions assume that sv[first, last) is ordered by comp.

.. function:: lower_bound /stlvec (sv, first, last) x comp

   returns an int designating the first position into which x can be inserted
   into sv[first, last) while maintaining the sorted ordering

.. function:: upper_bound /stlvec (sv, first, last) x comp

   returns an int designating the last position into which x can be inserted
   into sv[first, last) while maintaining the sorted ordering

.. function:: equal_range /stlvec (sv, first, last) x comp

   returns a pair of ints, (lower, upper) where lower and upper would have
   been returned by separate calls to lower_bound and upper_bound.

.. function:: binary_search /stlvec (sv, first, last) x comp

   returns true if x is an element of sv[first, last)

Examples
--------

See ut_sort.pure in the pure-stlvec/ut directory.


STL Merge Algorithms
====================

The stlvec::merge module provides an interface to the STL's merge
algorithms. These algorithms operate on sorted ranges.

Imports
-------

To use the operations of this module, add the following import declaration
to your program::

  using stlvec::merge;

All of the functions are in the stl namespace.

Operations
----------

All of the functions in this module require the caller to supply an ordering
function, comp (as for the Pure library sort function). They only work
properly on input ranges that have been previously sorted using comp. The set
operations generally do not check for range overflow because it is not
generally possible to determine the length of the result of a set operation
until after it is completed. In most cases you will get a nasty segmentation
fault if the result is bigger than the target range. The best way to avoid
this possibility it to use a back iterator to specifify the target range.

See parameter naming conventions at ..

.. function:: merge /stlvec (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) (msv,p) comp

   merges the two sorted ranges into the sorted range msv[p,p+n) where n is
   the total length of the merged sequence

   places the sorted union of sv1[first1,last1) and
   sv2[first2,last2) into msv[p,p+n) where n is the number
   of elements in the sorted union, and returns the past-the-end position of
   the sorted union

.. function:: set_intersection /stlvec (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) (msv,p) comp

   places the sorted intersection of sv1[first1,last1) and sv2[first2,last2)
   into msv[p,p+n) where n is the number of elements in the sorted
   intersection, and returns p+n (or stl::svend, if applicable)

.. function:: set_difference /stlvec (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) (msv,p) comp

   places the sorted difference of sv1[first1,last1) and sv2[first2,last2)
   into msv[p,p+n) where n is the number of elements in the sorted difference,
   and returns p+n (or stl::svend, if applicable)

.. function:: set_symmetric_difference /stlvec (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) (msv,p) comp

   places the sorted symmetric_difference of sv1[first1,last1) and
   sv2[first2,last2) into msv[p,p+n) where n is the number of elements in the
   sorted symmetric_difference, and returns returns p+n (or stl::svend, if
   applicable)

and (>) are commonly passed as comp.

.. function:: make_heap /stlvec (msv,first,last) comp

   rearranges the elements of msv[first,last) so that they are a
   heap, i.e., after this msv!first will be the largest element in
   msv[first,last), and push_heap and pop_heap will work properly

.. function:: push_heap /stlvec (msv,first,last) comp

    makes msv[first,last) a heap (assuming that msv[first,last-1) was a heap)

.. function:: pop_heap /stlvec (msv,first,last) comp

.. function:: lexicographical_compare /stlvec (sv1,first1,last1) (sv2,first2,last2) comp

   compares sv1[first1,last1) and sv2[first2,last2) element by element
   according to the ordering defined by comp, and returns true if the first
   sequence is less than the second

Algorithms are provided for stepping through all the permutations the elements
of a stlvec. For these purposes, the first permutation has the elements of
msv[first,last) sorted in ascending order and the last has the elements sorted
in descending order.

.. function:: next_permutation /stlvec (msv,first,last) comp

Backward Compatibilty
=====================

.. namespace:: ::

This section documents changes in pure-stlvec that might have introduced
backward compatiblity issues.

pure-stlvec-0.2
---------------

Bug fixes.

pure-stlvec-0.3
---------------

Version 0.3 reflects some changes made to make :doc:`pure-stlvec` consistent
with its sister package, :doc:`pure-stlmap`.

The :func:`update/stlvec` function was deprecated. Please use
:func:`replace/stlvec` instead.

The :func:`replace/stlvec` function was added to the stlvec module. This
function is the same as :func:`update/stlvec` except that
":func:`replace/stlvec` sv i x" returns x instead of sv.

The :func:`stl::replace/stlvec` function was removed from the stlvec/modifying
module. You can use ":func:`stl::replace_if/stlvec` (sv,first,last) (x==) y"
instead of ":func:`stl::replace/stlvec` (sv,first,last) x y" to replace all
instances of x in the specified range.

The function :func:`null/stlvec` was removed and :func:`stl::empty/stlvec` was
added to replace it. 

The function :func:`list/stlvec` was removed. You can use
:func:`members/stlvec` instead.

The function :func:`stl::random_shuffle/stlvec` was changed to take a seed as
a second parameter.

All of the tracing functions were removed.

pure-stlvec-0.4
---------------

Fixed (>) predicate operating on plain old data when passed to STL algorithms.
